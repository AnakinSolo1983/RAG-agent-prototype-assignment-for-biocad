41607364,"Overnight Dynamics of Ventricular Cerebrospinal Fluid Amyloid-Beta, Lactate and Hypocretin in Patients With Hydrocephalus: A Pilot Study.","This pilot observational study evaluated whether frequent overnight sampling of ventricular cerebrospinal fluid could clarify how sleep, hypocretin and lactate relate to amyloid-β42 dynamics in adults with hydrocephalus. Seven participants underwent hourly ventricular cerebrospinal fluid sampling from early evening to late morning during inpatient monitoring, combined with full polysomnography. Concentrations of amyloid-β42, hypocretin, lactate, melatonin and electrolytes were measured and normalised to each individual's mean. Relationships with sleep stage and circadian patterns were examined using correlation analysis and cosinor modelling. Sleep was markedly disrupted, with obstructive sleep apnea common and analysable sleep data available for six participants. Non-rapid eye movement sleep peaked at approximately 4 AM Amyloid-β42 rose in the evening, plateaued during peak non-rapid eye movement sleep and increased sharply after 8 AM Hypocretin and lactate were positively correlated and each preceded and correlated with amyloid-β42 surges. Melatonin peaked near 6 AM and was associated with non-rapid eye movement sleep. Intracranial pressure displayed a strong circadian rhythm, peaking during non-rapid eye movement sleep, whereas hypocretin and amyloid-β42 exhibited only modest rhythmicity. These findings demonstrate that overnight ventricular cerebrospinal fluid sampling is feasible in adults with hydrocephalus. Preliminary evidence suggests that processes linked to wakefulness, rather than sleep or intrinsic circadian timing, may be the primary drivers of overnight amyloid-β42 variation. Hypocretin pathways may represent potential therapeutic targets in Alzheimer's disease, but conclusions are limited by abnormal sleep architecture and underlying neurological disease. Validation in larger and more representative populations is warranted."
41604552,Multi-View Biomedical Foundation Models for Molecule-Target and Property Prediction.,"Molecular foundation models hold promise to provide accurate predictions for a large and diverse set of downstream tasks in bio-medical research. Quality molecular representations are key and foundation model development has typically focused on a single representation or molecular view, which may have strengths or weaknesses on a given task. We develop Multi-view Molecular Embedding with Late Fusion (MMELON), an approach that integrates pre-trained graph, image and text foundation models and may be readily extended to additional views and models. The multi-view model performs robustly and is validated on over 120 tasks, including molecular solubility, ADME properties, and activity against G Protein-Coupled receptors (GPCRs). The GPCR model array is leveraged to perform a virtual screen in search of ligands binding to Alzheimer's disease related GPCRs. We identify a number of such targets and employ the multi-view model to select strong binders from a compound screen. Predictions are validated through structure-based modeling and identification of key binding motifs."
41596653,"Design, Synthesis, and Biological Evaluation of Novel Acetylcholinesterase and β-Secretase 1 Inhibitors.","A series of novel granatane-triazole hybrid molecules was designed, synthesized, and evaluated as dual acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and β-secretase 1 (BACE1) inhibitors. The compounds were obtained through a convergent synthetic route involving azide formation, triazole construction via dipolar cycloaddition, and final coupling with a granatane scaffold to give a pseudopelletierine (3-granatanone) analogue. In vitro assays demonstrated that all target compounds inhibited both AChE and BACE1. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations revealed stable interactions with key catalytic residues, suggesting distinct binding modes compared to reference ligands. QSAR-based pharmacokinetic predictions indicated favorable blood-brain barrier permeability and compliance with key drug-likeness filters. These findings identify granatane-triazole hybrids as promising multi-target directed ligand (MTDL) candidates with potential for further optimization in the search for new anti-Alzheimer therapeutics."
41599761,Aptamer-Based Delivery of Genes and Drugs Across the Blood-Brain Barrier.,"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) restricts therapeutic delivery to the central nervous system (CNS), hindering the treatment of neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, brain cancers, and stroke. Aptamers, short single-stranded DNA or RNA oligonucleotides that can fold into unique 3D shapes and bind to specific target molecules, offer high affinity and specificity, low immunogenicity, and promising BBB penetration via receptor-mediated transcytosis targeting receptors such as the transferrin receptor (TfR) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1). This review examines aptamer design through the Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX) and its variants, mechanisms of BBB crossing, and applications in CNS disorders. Recent advances, including in silico optimization, in vivo SELEX, BBB chip-based MPS-SELEX, and nanoparticle-aptamer hybrids, have identified brain-penetrating aptamers and enhanced the brain delivery efficiency. This review highlights the potential of aptamers to transform CNS-targeted therapies."
41590318,Smart Biosensing Nanomaterials for Alzheimer's Disease: Advances in Design and Drug Delivery Strategies to Overcome the Blood-Brain Barrier.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder marked by persistent memory impairment and complex molecular and cellular pathological changes in the brain. Current treatments, including acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and memantine, only help with symptoms for a short time and do not stop the disease from getting worse. This is mainly because these drugs do not reach the brain well and are quickly removed from the body. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) restricts the entry of most drugs into the central nervous system; therefore, new methods of drug delivery are needed. Nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems (NTDDS) are widely studied as a potential approach to address existing therapeutic limitations. Smart biosensing nanoparticles composed of polymers, lipids, and metals can be engineered to enhance drug stability, improve drug availability, and target specific brain regions. These smart nanoparticles can cross the BBB via receptor-mediated transcytosis and other transport routes, making them a promising option for treating AD. Additionally, multifunctional nanocarriers enable controlled drug release and offer theranostic capabilities, supporting real-time tracking of AD treatment responses to facilitate more precise and personalized interventions. Despite these advantages, challenges related to long-term safety, manufacturing scalability, and regulatory approval remain. This review discusses current AD therapies, drug-delivery strategies, recent advances in nanoparticle platforms, and prospects for translating nanomedicine into effective, disease-modifying treatments for AD."
41599368,Experimental Models and Translational Strategies in Neuroprotective Drug Development with Emphasis on Alzheimer's Disease.,"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), are becoming more prevalent and still lack effective disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). However, translational efficiency remains critically low. For example, a ClinicalTrials.gov analysis of AD programs (2002-2012) estimated ~99.6% attrition, while PD programs (1999-2019) achieved an overall success rate of ~14.9%. In vitro platforms are assessed, ranging from immortalized neuronal lines and primary cultures to human-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons/glia, neuron-glia co-cultures (including neuroinflammation paradigms), 3D spheroids, organoids, and blood-brain barrier (BBB)-on-chip systems. Complementary in vivo toxin, pharmacological, and genetic models are discussed for systems-level validation and central nervous system (CNS) exposure realism. The therapeutic synthesis focuses on AD, covering symptomatic drugs, anti-amyloid immunotherapies, tau-directed approaches, and repurposed drug classes that target metabolism, neuroinflammation, and network dysfunction. This review links experimental models to translational decision-making, focusing primarily on AD and providing a brief comparative context from other NDDs. It also covers emerging targeted protein degradation (PROTACs). Key priorities include neuroimmune/neurovascular human models, biomarker-anchored adaptive trials, mechanism-guided combination DMTs, and CNS PK/PD-driven development for brain-directed degraders."
41547241,Targeting neuroinflammation by activation of the sigma-1 receptor (S1R) and inhibition of butyrylcholinesterase (hBChE) leads to highly potent anti-amnesic compounds in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder for which no effective preventative or curative treatment has yet been identified. Due to the multifactorial nature and complex pathophysiology of the disease, we developed a multi-target ligand that both inhibits human butyrylcholinesterase (hBChE), a key enzyme linked to β-amyloid plaque formation, and activates the sigma-1 receptor (S1R), which modulates neuroinflammatory and protective pathways. To this end, a series of isoindolines were designed and synthesized, and their biological activities were evaluated. The most promising compound, 7c, exhibited significant dual activity, achieving nanomolar IC<sub>50</sub> values against hBChE and potent S1R activation. Subsequent in vivo studies in an Aβ<sub>25-35</sub> mouse model revealed a remarkable improvement in cognitive deficits in both short- and long-term memory at an effective dose of 0.01 mg/kg in WT Swiss-OF1 mice. This dose is 10-fold lower compared to single-target compounds 7a and 7b of this isoindoline series. The lack of neuroprotective effects in BChE knock-out (KO) mice confirmed the involvement of BChE inhibition in the pharmacological effects of compound 7c in WT mice. Further combinatorial studies employing a two-drug combination demonstrated synergy in the neuroprotective effect of addressing the two targets."
41553588,"Metallothioneins in Neurodegenerative Diseases: Metal Homeostasis, Autoimmunity, and Therapeutic Potential.","Neurodegenerative diseases, including multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, are characterized by progressive neuronal loss and are frequently linked to metal dysregulation, oxidative stress, and immune dysfunction. Metallothioneins (MTs), a family of cysteine-rich, metal-binding proteins, are critical in maintaining metal homeostasis, mitigating oxidative damage, and modulating immune responses, functions highly relevant in these pathologies. MTs regulate essential metals like copper and iron by preventing their participation in harmful redox reactions and control zinc availability for enzymatic and signaling processes. They also detoxify neurotoxic metal(oid)s such as cadmium, mercury, lead, and arsenic, thereby reducing their adverse neurological and immunological effects. In autoimmune neurodegeneration, MTs modulate pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6, TNF-α, IL-10) and influence immune cell activity, particularly microglia and T cells, which are central to neuroinflammation and autoimmunity. Through these mechanisms, MTs play a dual role in sustaining immune homeostasis and counteracting oxidative stress. Their capacity to integrate metal regulation with immune modulation positions them as promising therapeutic targets, with preclinical and some clinical evidence supporting strategies to enhance MT expression or develop MT-mimetic agents to address both metal dysregulation and immune imbalance. Additionally, MTs show emerging utility as biomarkers, as alterations in MT isoform expression and metal-bound complexes in biofluids have been associated with disease onset, progression, and therapeutic response in specific neurodegenerative conditions. This article reviews the multifaceted roles of MTs in neurodegenerative diseases, emphasizing their function in metal and immune regulation and their emerging potential as therapeutic targets and clinical biomarkers."
41599691,The Expanding Role of Non-Coding RNAs in Neurodegenerative Diseases: From Biomarkers to Therapeutic Targets.,"Non-coding RNAs have emerged as central regulators of gene expression in neurodegenerative diseases, offering new opportunities for diagnosis and therapy. This review synthesizes current knowledge on microRNAs, long non-coding RNAs, and circular RNAs in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, emphasizing their roles in synaptic function, proteostasis, mitochondrial biology, and neuroinflammation. We evaluate evidence supporting non-coding RNAs as circulating and tissue-based biomarkers for early detection, disease monitoring, and patient stratification, and we compare analytical platforms and biofluid sources. Mechanistic insights reveal how non-coding RNAs modulate pathogenic protein aggregation, neuronal excitability, immune cell crosstalk, and blood-brain barrier integrity. Translational efforts toward RNA-targeted interventions are reviewed, including antisense oligonucleotides, small interfering RNAs, miRNA mimics and inhibitors, circular RNA decoys, and extracellular vesicle-mediated delivery systems. We discuss pharmacological modulation, delivery challenges, safety concerns, and strategies to enhance specificity and CNS penetration. Finally, we outline emerging computational and multi-omics approaches to prioritize therapeutic targets and propose a roadmap for advancing non-coding RNA research from preclinical models to clinical trials. Addressing biological heterogeneity and delivery barriers will be pivotal to realizing the diagnostic and therapeutic promise of the non-coding transcriptome in neurodegenerative disease. Collaboration across disciplines and rigorous clinical validation are urgently needed."
41588609,From gut to brain: formulation and transporter-guided approaches to maximise rutin central nervous system delivery.,"Neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, are characterised by high morbidity and disability, representing a major global health challenge. A central obstacle in their treatment is the <i>blood-brain barrier</i>, a highly selective interface that limits drug delivery to the central nervous system. Rutin, a naturally occurring flavonoid, exhibits potent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective activities, yet its clinical utility remains constrained by poor solubility, low oral bioavailability, and restricted <i>blood-brain barrier</i> permeability. Recent advances in drug delivery and formulation science offer promising solutions. Nanoparticle encapsulation, peptide conjugation, intranasal delivery, and co-administration with absorption enhancers have been shown to improve rutin's solubility, metabolic stability, and central nervous system penetration in preclinical models. Mechanistic studies further reveal that rutin can modulate efflux transporters, regulate tight-junction proteins, and influence microglial activity and cellular metabolism, collectively contributing to enhanced neuroprotection. Experimental evidence highlights its potential to mitigate key neurodegenerative processes, particularly in Alzheimer's disease. This review synthesises current knowledge on rutin's pharmacological effects, limitations in bioavailability, and innovative strategies to improve <i>blood-brain barrier</i> penetration. By integrating mechanistic insights with advances in delivery technologies, this review underscores rutin's translational potential. Priority next steps include optimising delivery systems, establishing long-term safety, and conducting well-designed clinical trials to define efficacy and dosing."
41597249,Olfactory Dysfunction and Cognitive Deterioration in Long COVID: Pathomechanisms and Clinical Implications in Development of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Complete or partial loss of smell (anosmia), sometimes in association with distorted olfactory perceptions (parosmia), is a common neurological symptom affecting nearly 60% of patients suffering from post-acute neurological sequelae of COronaVIrus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) syndrome, called long COVID. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may gain access from the nasal cavity to the brain (neurotropism), and the olfactory route has been proposed as a peripheral site of virus entry. COVID-19 is a risk factor for developing Alzheimer's Disease (AD), an age-dependent and progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized in affected patients by early olfaction dysfunction that precedes signs of cognitive decline associated with neurodegeneration in vulnerable brain regions of their limbic system. Here, we summarize the recent literature data supporting the causal correlation between the persistent olfactory deterioration following SARS-CoV-2 infection and the long-delayed manifestation of AD-like memory impairment. SARS-CoV-2 infection of the olfactory neuroepithelium is likely to trigger a pattern of detrimental events that, directly and/or indirectly, affect the anatomically interconnected hippocampal and cortical areas, thus resulting in tardive clinical dementia. We also delineate future advancement on pharmacological and rehabilitative treatments to improve the olfactory dysfunction in patients recovering even from the acute/mild phase of COVID-19. Collectively, the present review aims at highlighting the physiopathological nexus between COVID-19 anosmia and post-pandemic mental health to favor the development of best-targeted and more effective therapeutic strategies in the fight against the long-term neurological complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection."
41547891,Intranasal blood-brain barrier bypass enables sequential mitochondria-targeted bioengineered nanolamellar system for ischemic stroke therapy.,"Mitochondrial damage constitutes the central pathological mechanism of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Targeted delivery of antioxidants to mitochondria and the phenotype polarization of glial cells holds great promise for effective treatment. However, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) remains a major obstacle, causing insufficient drug accumulation in neuronal mitochondria. Here, we develop a bioengineered nanolamellar system (MM@BPPF) by coating microglia-mitochondria hybrid biomembrane onto black phosphorus nanosheets (BP NSs) loaded with polymetformin (PolyMet) and fingolimod hydrochloride (FTY720). Microglia membrane facilitates inflammation-directed targeting to the injured brain regions, while mitochondria membrane confers homotypic targeting to mitochondria. Meanwhile, BP NSs, PolyMet, and FTY720 act sequentially to restore mitochondrial function of neuronal cells and modulate microglial polarization. Intranasal administration enables MM@BPPF to bypass the BBB, substantially improving brain-targeting efficiency. This work not only offers an innovative sequential targeting strategy for mitigating I/R injury but also presents a potential paradigm for treating other central nervous system disorders."
41564643,Development and quality control studies of radiolabelled nanostructured lipid formulations with Ga-68.,"This study aims to radiolabel a nanoparticle formulation containing donepezil with Ga-68 radionuclide with high efficiency for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease. In order to develop lipid carrier systems with biocompatible contents in nanoparticle structures, extensive formulation studies were conducted. These systems were subsequently radiolabeled with Ga-68 radionuclide to evaluate their radiolabeling efficiencies. The results are highly encouraging, suggesting that effective radiolabeling is indeed possible. These findings are particularly significant as they open up a range of applications for targeted drug delivery, medical imaging, and diagnostics. Overall, this study represents a valuable contribution to the expanding body of knowledge on lipid carrier systems in healthcare. Nanocarrier formulations were prepared. The radiolabeling parameters of the prepared formulations were studied comparatively. A Ga-68 radionuclide with a half-life of 68 min was used for this. Incubation time, amount of radioactivity, and pH parameters were studied. The radiolabeling incubation time, pH of the experimental medium, and amount of radioactivity were tested, and the optimal parameters were identified. According to the results of the radiolabeling studies, optimal radiolabeling with Ga-68 radionuclide was obtained in an acid medium (pH: 5), with a 60 min incubation time, and using 5 mCi of activity in the DOTA-functionalized nanolipid formulations, achieving 89.17 % efficiency. Furthermore, quantitative in vivo PET/CT imaging in nude mice (n = 3/group) demonstrated that the optimized Ga-68-DNP-NLC formulation achieved statistically significant and higher brain uptake compared to the free Ga-68 control, confirming its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier."
41548855,Metal-directed nanomedicines for imaging-guided disease treatment.,"Metal-directed self-assembly, driven by metal-ligand coordination, represents a highly versatile and efficient strategy for constructing drug delivery systems with precisely tunable properties, inherent imaging capabilities, and broad biomedical applications. Stimuli-responsive metal-directed drug delivery systems (MDDSs), guided by advanced imaging techniques, enable precise control over their size and spatial architecture while facilitating site-specific drug release. Moreover, certain metal ions play a dual role, not only orchestrating the self-assembly process but also serving as therapeutic agents and regulatory components for the treatment of various diseases, including cancer, microbial infections, and Alzheimer's disease. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the self-assembly mechanisms underlying diverse MDDSs and their applications in image-guided therapy. Furthermore, we critically examine existing challenges in the field and propose strategic directions to propel the advancement of metal-directed self-assembly in drug delivery. Given the profound implications of this research, further exploration of the critical roles of metal coordination in self-assembly is imperative for the development of next-generation drug delivery platforms. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This review systematically summarize the self-assembly mechanisms of metal-directed drug delivery systems, outlines their applications in image-guided therapy and discusses the current challenges that remain. Furthermore, it elucidates the unique regulatory roles of metal ions in precise drug release and multimodal therapy, providing valuable insights and broad appeal for the development and clinical translation of next-generation smart nanomedicine platforms."
41579998,Carboxymethyl chitosan for neurological drug delivery: Current trends and future prospects.,"The complexity of drug delivery across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) makes disorders of the central nervous system (CNS), such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease(PD), brain tumors, and other neurodegenerative conditions, a growing global health burden. Poor brain bioavailability and systemic side effects are common problems with traditional therapies. Delivery systems based on nanotechnology have shown promise as solutions to these problems. These include carboxymethyl chitosan (CMC), a water-soluble, biocompatible, and biodegradable chitosan derivative that has drawn a lot of interest because of its increased stability, mucoadhesiveness, improved solubility at physiological pH, and ability to encapsulate and release targeted drugs. CMC-based nanocarriers are perfect for treating a variety of conditions because they have shown promise in increasing therapeutic efficacy while reducing toxicity. Recently developed CMC-based drug delivery systems for CNS disorders are examined critically in this review, with an emphasis on their design, biological performance, targeting techniques, and potential for clinical translation in the future. Their multifunctional qualities, in vitro and in vivo evidence, and their function in regulating neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and neuronal regeneration are given particular attention."
41603986,Computational prioritization of multi-target inhibitors: explainable QSAR and docking-based discovery of dual AChE/BACE1 chemotypes.,"The discovery of dual acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and β-secretase (BACE1) inhibitors remains a promising strategy against multifactorial Alzheimer's disease. Here, rigorously curated ChEMBL-derived data were used to develop explainable QSAR (Quantitative structure-activity relationship) models for dual-inhibition prioritization. Molecules were standardized, near-duplicates were removed using a Tanimoto similarity threshold (≥ 0.80), and physicochemical outliers were filtered prior to modeling. Multiple classifiers (including Light Gradient-Boosting Machine, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, k-Nearest Neighbors and Gradient Boosting Decision Trees) and fingerprints (e.g., RDKit fingerprints, Extended Connectivity Fingerprint) were benchmarked under scaffold-based nested cross-validation to prevent data leakage. Class imbalance was handled with SMOTETomek applied strictly within training folds. Model selection relied on F-Score, Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), and Recall, and performance was accompanied by bootstrap confidence intervals, calibration curves, and Y-randomization controls. In classification, the top model (GBDT + ECFP6) achieved strong generalization (Recall ≈ 1.00, PR-AUC ≈ 0.84, MCC ≈ 0.81, F1 Score ≈ 0.84). Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis highlighted aromatic and hydrogen-bonding substructures as key positive contributors. Prospective candidates (e.g., CHEMBL5082250, CHEMBL1651126, CHEMBL1651127) were evaluated by active-site-focused docking against AChE (PDB: 4EY7) and BACE1 (PDB: 2G94) with essential waters retained; docking scores (ΔG, kcal·mol⁻<sup>1</sup>) were used for relative ranking of the ligands. SwissADME/pkCSM profiling suggested CNS-relevant properties (e.g., MPO, logBB, P-gp liability) and acceptable oral drug-likeness. Collectively, the workflow provides a reproducible and transparent pipeline for prioritizing dual AChE/BACE1 chemotypes and nominates testable scaffolds for experimental validation."
41575328,Targeted Delivery of Quercetin to the Brain via a Modified Polymeric Nanocarrier.,"Quercetin (Qt) exhibits significant neuroprotective potential in Alzheimer's disease; however, its clinical translation is limited by poor solubility, low permeability, and inadequate brain bioavailability. In this study, a modified polymeric nanocarrier was developed to enhance Qt delivery to the brain. Polyethyleneimine (PEI) was conjugated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and further functionalized with phenylalanine to reduce PEI-associated toxicity and improve brain-targeting efficiency. Successful polymer synthesis was confirmed by FT-IR spectroscopy, showing characteristic S─S bond formation at 790 cm<sup>-</sup> <sup>1</sup>, mass spectrometry (m/z 1087.3), and differential scanning calorimetry. Nanoparticles were optimized using a Quality by Design approach, yielding an experimental particle size of 161.4 ± 1.10 nm, zeta potential of 15.9 ± 2.5 mV, and high entrapment efficiencies of 84.21 % and 86.74 % for Qt-PEI-Np and Qt-PEI-PEG-S-S-AA-Np, respectively. SEM analysis revealed spherical nanoparticles with nanoscale surface roughness and good stability. In vitro release studies demonstrated sustained Qt release (98 % over 48 h). MTT assays and cytokine analysis (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) confirmed biocompatibility. Enhanced intestinal permeability, absence of hippocampal toxicity, and effective BBB transport further support the potential of this nanocarrier for targeted neurotherapeutic delivery."
41604360,"A Global, Regional, and National Survey on Burden and Quality of Care Index of Alzheimer's Disease and Other Dementias in Adults Aged 55 and Above: The Global Burden of Disease Study 1990-2021.","Alzheimer's disease and other dementias (ADOD) represent a growing global health challenge. This study aims to propose a comprehensive measure called the quality of care index (QCI) to assess disparities in quality of care (QC) for ADOD patients across global, regional, and national levels. We also evaluate temporal trends in QCI and explore associations with socioeconomic development, gender, and age. Individuals aged 55 years and older with ADOD were included in this longitudinal study using data from the global burden of disease (GBD) database spanning 1990-2021. The QCI score was calculated using four indicators. Principal component analysis was employed to compute the QCI. The QCI was rescaled to a single index ranging from 0 to 100, where higher scores indicate better QC. The global QCI increased from 32.9 in 1990 to 50.2 in 2021, with a greater increase among females (68.8%) than males (52.4%). Significant gains were observed in regions with middle and high-middle sociodemographic index), while slight declines occurred in high- and low-middle SDI regions, and slow progress was seen in low SDI regions. The gender gap in QCI narrowed, with females outperforming males in low SDI regions. QCI scores showed a marked increase with age, reflecting lower QC access in younger age groups and a sharp rise in older age groups. Substantial disparities in QCI exist globally and regionally across age cohorts and between men and women. Policymakers should prioritize targeted interventions to address these gaps, improve access to high-quality care, and alleviate the global burden of ADOD."
41570392,"Clinical, imaging and blood biomarker outcomes in a Phase 3 clinical trial of tau aggregation inhibitor hydromethylthionine mesylate in mild cognitive impairment and mild to moderate dementia due to Alzheimer's disease.","Hydromethylthionine mesylate (HMTM) targets tau pathology and has tau-independent symptomatic activity. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of HMTM in participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild to moderate dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). 82 centres in Canada, European Union, United Kingdom and United States of America. A total of 598 amyloid β-PET positive participants were included; 44% (263) met clinical criteria for MCI due to Alzheimer's disease and 56% (335) were diagnosed with mild to moderate dementia due to AD. HMTM 16 mg/day and 8 mg/day were compared with methylthioninium chloride (MTC) 4 mg twice weekly, intended as an inactive urinary colourant to preserve blinding with respect to possible urinary discolouration caused by HMTM. HMTM and MTC were compared on cognitive and functional endpoints for the first 52 weeks followed by all receiving HMTM 16 mg/day to 104 weeks in a modified delayed-start trial design. Biomarker outcomes included change in plasma levels of neurofilament light chain (NfL), pTau217 and MRI measures of grey matter atrophy. It was not possible to demonstrate significant differences on the co-primary clinical endpoints (ADAS-cog<sub>11</sub> and ADCS-ADL<sub>23</sub>) at 52 weeks due to symptomatic activity in the control arm. In participants with MCI, statistically significant differences in cognitive decline (ADAS-cog<sub>13</sub>) emerged at 78 weeks (p = 0·0291) and 104 weeks (p = 0·0308) between early- and delayed-start HMTM 16 mg/day in analyses specified prior to the 24-month database lock. Statistically significant cognitive improvement over baseline score was sustained for 78 weeks in the early start MCI group, with no significant cognitive or functional decline to 104 weeks. There was a significant reduction in progression of neurodegeneration measured by NfL change (p = 0·0291) at 52 weeks in the whole population, consistent with significant reductions in progression of grey matter atrophy at 52 and 104 weeks, and a reduction in progression of tau pathology (pTau217, p = 0·0165) in MCI. Headache (1·5%) and diarrhoea (1·2%) were the most frequent adverse effects. Although HMTM 16 mg/day arrested progression of neurodegeneration and reduced grey matter atrophy at 52 weeks, symptomatic activity in the control arm precluded separation of treatment arms at 52 weeks on primary clinical endpoints. In participants with MCI, significant clinical separation was seen only at 78 and 104 weeks. This effect has been confirmed in a further study. HMTM was well tolerated and has the potential to offer an accessible oral treatment option with a benign safety profile which could be delivered with minimal patient/physician burden."
41601548,Ferroptosis in Alzheimer's disease: molecular mechanisms and advances in therapeutic strategies.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized primarily by the continuous decline of cognitive functions. Its pathogenesis involves complex, multidimensional interactions among various molecular pathways. In recent years, ferroptosis, a regulated form of iron-dependent cell death, has emerged as a crucial contributor to AD progression. Ferroptosis is defined by the accumulation of lipid peroxides and inactivation of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), and is typically initiated in the context of disrupted iron homeostasis, aberrant lipid metabolism, and mitochondrial dysfunction in the brain. This review comprehensively delineates the molecular mechanisms underlying dysregulated iron metabolism in AD and proposes an integrative ""iron-lipid-energy-inflammation"" axis as a pathological framework. Particular attention is given to the GPX4 signaling pathway as a central hub linking lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial damage, and immune responses. Moreover, ferroptosis can propagate through intercellular mechanisms involving the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), dysregulation of immune checkpoints, and exosome-mediated signaling, collectively driving microglial activation, T-cell infiltration, and blood-brain barrier disruption, culminating in systemic immune imbalance. We further evaluate multiple therapeutic strategies targeting ferroptosis, including iron chelators, antioxidants, GPX4 activators, and lipoxygenase inhibitors. Based on emerging evidence, we propose a precision medicine approach that incorporates ferroptosis subtyping, multi-omics analysis, and targeted delivery systems. Ferroptosis represents a promising frontier for early diagnosis and intervention in AD, potentially enabling the development of causality-oriented, mechanism-based therapies."
41596255,Targeting the Gut Microbiota: Mechanistic Investigation of Polyphenol Modulation of the Gut-Brain Axis in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents an increasingly severe global health challenge. Recently, the role of the gut-brain axis in AD pathogenesis has garnered significant attention. Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota can exacerbate core pathologies such as neuroinflammation, amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition, and tau hyperphosphorylation through neural, endocrine, and immune pathways. Polyphenolic compounds have emerged as a focal point in neuroprotective research owing to their pronounced anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Notably, polyphenols exert effects not only by directly influencing the central nervous system (CNS) but also through indirectly modulating the composition and function of the gut microbiota, thereby impacting bidirectional gut-brain communication. This dual mechanism offers a potential avenue for their application in the prevention and treatment of AD. This review aims to compile recent research on the relationship between polyphenols and the gut microbiota. We assessed the literature from PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science databases, published from the establishment of the database to 24 November 2025. The keywords used include ""Polyphenols"", ""Gut-brain axis"", ""Gut microbiota"", ""Alzheimer's disease"", ""Epigallocatechin gallate"", ""Quercetin"", ""Curcumin"", ""Ferulic acid"", ""Resveratrol"", ""Anthocyanin"", ""Myricetin"", ""Chlorogenic acid"", etc. This review discusses the various mechanisms by which polyphenols influence AD through modulating the gut microbiota. Polyphenols and gut microbiota exhibit critical bidirectional interactions. On one hand, the bioavailability and activity of polyphenols are highly dependent on metabolic conversion by gut microbiota. On the other hand, polyphenols selectively promote the proliferation of beneficial bacteria such as bifidobacteria and lactobacilli like prebiotics, while inhibiting the growth of pathogenic bacteria. This reshapes the intestinal microecology, enhances barrier function, and regulates beneficial metabolites. Utilizing a nanotechnology-based drug delivery system, the pharmacokinetic stability and brain targeting efficacy of polyphenols can be significantly enhanced, providing innovative opportunities for the targeted prevention and management of AD."
41604898,Sinomenine inhibits oxidative stress to attenuate Alzheimer's disease pathology via α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.,"The pathological mechanism of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is complex. The binding of Aβ to α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) contributes to neuronal damage. Sinomenine (SIN) is an alkaloid extracted from the traditional Chinese medicine Qingfengteng (Sinomenium acutum). The anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory effects of SIN were confirmed to be closely associated with the α7nAChR. This study aimed to investigate whether α7nAChR serves as a pharmacological target of SIN against AD, and to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of SIN both in vivo and in vitro, focusing on the α7nAChR/Nrf2/Keap1 signaling pathway. In this study, the effects of SIN in both APP/PS1 transgenic mice and SH-SY5Y cells subjected to Aβ1-42-induced injury were assessed. The selective antagonist α-bungarotoxin ‌(α-BTX), the agonist nicotine (Nic) of α7nAChR, and α7nAChR siRNA were employed. The cognitive function, Aβ deposition, synaptic plasticity markers, the tau protein phosphorylation, mitochondrial membrane potential, oxidative stress and the α7nAChR/Nrf2/Keap1 signaling pathway were analyzed in vivo and/or in vitro. SIN significantly enhanced learning and memory abilities in APP/PS1 mice, reduced Aβ plaque deposition and synaptic dysfunction, and inhibited hyperphosphorylation of tau protein and oxidative stress in the brain. In Aβ1-42-induced neuronal injury model, SIN alleviated apoptosis, increased BDNF and ACh levels, inhibited mitochondrial damage, stabilized calcium homeostasis, and suppressed oxidative stress. Meanwhile, SIN disrupted Nrf2-Keap1 binding to promote the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. Nevertheless, SIN effects above were inhibited by α-BTX. The knockdown of α7nAChR in vitro significantly promoted Nrf2/HO-1 pathway and BDNF expression. SIN exerts neuroprotective effect in APP/PS1 transgenic mice and Aβ1-42-induced neuronal injury by inhibiting oxidative stress via α7nAChR/Nrf2/Keap1 pathway. This study provides evidence for α7nAChR as a new target and the clinical application potential of SIN in AD treatment."
41595681,Network Analysis to Identify MicroRNAs Involved in Alzheimer's Disease and to Improve Drug Prioritization.,"<b>Background</b>: Advances in the understanding of molecular mechanisms of human diseases, along with the generation of large amounts of molecular datasets, have highlighted the variability between patients and the need to tailor therapies to individual characteristics. In particular, RNA-based therapies hold strong promise for new drug development, as they can be easily designed to target specific molecules. Gene and protein functions, however, operate within a highly interconnected network, and inhibiting a single function or repressing a single gene may lead to unexpected secondary effects. In this study, we focused on genes associated with Alzheimer's disease, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by complex pathological processes leading to cognitive decline and dementia. Its hallmark features include the accumulation of extracellular amyloid-β plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau. <b>Methods</b>: We built a protein interaction network subgraph seeded on five Alzheimer's-associated genes, including tau and amyloid-β precursor, and integrated it with microRNAs in order to select regulated nodes, study the effects of their depletion on signaling pathways, and prioritize targets for microRNA-based therapeutic approaches. <b>Results</b>: We identified nine protein nodes as potential candidates (Pik3R1, Bace1, Traf6, Gsk3b, Akt1, Cdk2, Adam10, Mapk3 and Apoe) and performed in silico node depletion to simulate the effects of microRNA regulation. <b>Conclusions</b>: Despite intrinsic limitations of the approach, such as the incompleteness of the available information or possible false associations, the present work shows clear potential for drug design and target prioritization and underscores the need for reliable and comprehensive maps of interactions and pathways."
41577863,Exploring Green-Synthesized Silver Nanoparticles in Neurodegeneration: a Systematic Review of Cholinesterase Enzyme Interactions.,"Neurodegenerative disorders, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD), represent a significant and growing global health concern in recent decades due to their complex pathology and lack of curative treatments. The fundamental cause of the evolution of these disorders is the dysfunction of cholinergic neurotransmission; those are mostly regulated by cholinesterase enzymes such as acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). Conventional synthetic cholinesterase inhibitors like donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine are proposed for symptomatic relief but are often associated with adverse effects, limited bioavailability, and decreased long-term efficacy. Here, green-synthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), which are derived from plant extracts and other biological systems, give an extraordinary alternative. These nanoparticles offer a biocompatible, eco-friendly, and cost-effective alternative to conventional synthetic methods. Greener AgNPs inhibit them by binding to the enzymes AChE and BChE and prevents them from breaking down neurotransmitters ACh and BCh. As a result, the count of neurotransmitters remains high in the synapse and can provide an effective synaptic transmission. Green-synthesized AgNPs can provide targeted drug delivery, enhance solubility, enhance bioavailability, improve absorption, and also be able to overcome the blood-brain barrier (BBB); all these characteristics give better therapeutic action than all conventional methods. This study evaluates the efficacy of green-synthesized silver nanoparticles in combination with several medicinal plants for treating neurodegenerative diseases, encouraging further research to upgrade these formulations for improved patient outcomes and increased clinical applicability."
41605956,SMILES-based QSAR analysis of carbamate derivatives targeting butyrylcholinesterase.,"Butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) is a key enzyme implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and its inhibition represents a promising therapeutic strategy for disease management. Among various inhibitor classes, carbamate derivatives have attracted significant attention due to their pseudo-irreversible inhibition mechanism and favorable pharmacological profiles, making them valuable scaffolds in anti-Alzheimer drug discovery. In this study, a dataset of 205 carbamate derivatives was carefully compiled from reliable peer-reviewed literature, and QSAR modeling was performed for the first time on this dataset. Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models were constructed to predict the BuChE inhibitory activity (pIC50) employing Monte Carlo optimization within the CORAL-2023 software framework. Hybrid optimal descriptors derived from SMILES notation and hydrogen-suppressed molecular graphs were utilized. Sixty models were developed across four random splits using four distinct target functions (TF0-TF3), among which the TF3-based models exhibited superior statistical performance (validation R<sup>2</sup> ranging from 0.80 to 0.86, Q<sup>2</sup> between 0.78 and 0.84, and RMSE values from 0.45 to 0.54). The mechanistic interpretation of the model showed that the increasing SMILES-based descriptors correspond to key pharmacophoric regions of the BuChE active site, including the PAS, acyl pocket, and catalytic triad. These correlations confirm that aromatic, hydrophobic, and branched fragments enhance inhibitory activity through π-π interactions, hydrophobic anchoring, and optimal orientation toward Ser198."
41604441,Spatial variation in socio-economic vulnerability to Influenza-like Infection for the US population.,"This study aims to quantify environmental health impacts and assess risk by understanding the disproportionate burden of infectious diseases, specifically Influenza-like Illness (ILI), across regions with varying socio-economic characteristics. We introduce a novel vulnerability-based approach to better understand the complex relationship between socio-economic factors and ILI burden. We developed a machine-learning-driven framework to assess and map state-level socio-economic vulnerability to ILI in the United States. A vulnerability index was created by integrating 39 diverse socio-economic and health indicators from the latest CENSUS. A Random Forest Regression model then weighed these indicators to quantify each state's vulnerability for the ILI values in 2022. To assess multicollinearity, Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) was calculated, and parameters were filtered to reduce the VIF. Key determinants of vulnerability include migration patterns, insurance coverage, and proportions of female and elderly populations. The resulting state-level vulnerability map reveals significant regional disparities. District of Columbia was identified as the most vulnerable state, followed by Massachusetts, Hawaii, New Mexico, and Rhode Island, all with normalized vulnerability indices exceeding 0.35. Our findings highlight significant regional variations in ILI vulnerability, emphasizing the need for targeted public health interventions tailored to state-specific socio-economic conditions. This scalable and adaptable methodology extends beyond influenza, offering a valuable approach for assessing vulnerability to a wide range of infectious diseases, strengthening epidemic preparedness and response."
41599177,"Extracellular Vesicles in Alzheimer's Disease: Dual Roles in Pathogenesis, Promising Avenues for Diagnosis and Therapy.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, neurofibrillary tau tangles, chronic neuroinflammation, and synaptic loss, leading to cognitive decline. Extracellular vesicles (EVs)-lipid bilayer nanoparticles secreted by nearly all cell types-have emerged as critical mediators of intercellular communication, playing a complex dual role in both the pathogenesis and potential treatment of AD. This review generally delineates two opposite roles of EVs in pathogenesis and potential treatment of AD. On one hand, EVs derived from neurons, astrocytes, microglia and oligodendrocytes can propagate toxic proteins (Aβ, tau) and inflammatory signals, thereby accelerating disease progression. On the other hand, EVs-especially those from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-exert neuroprotective effects by facilitating toxic protein clearance, modulating immune responses, preserving synaptic integrity, and alleviating oxidative stress. The cargo-carrying function of EVs gives them considerable diagnostic value. The associated cargos such as proteins and microRNAs (miRNAs) in the EVs may serve as minimally invasive biomarkers for early detection and monitoring of AD. Therapeutically, engineered EVs, including those incorporating CRISPR/Cas9-based genetic modification, are being developed as sophisticated delivery platforms for targeting core AD pathologies. Furthermore, this review highlights emerging technologies such as microfluidic chips and focused ultrasound (FUS), discussing their potential to enhance the translational prospects of EV-based early diagnostic and treatment for AD."
41572752,The Interplay between PKC and ELAV4 in the CNS: An Emerging Therapeutic Axis for Dementia Management.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent cause of dementia, accounting for 60-80% of all cases and characterized by amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques and tau protein hyperphosphorylation. Among the signaling mechanisms implicated in AD, protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms and neuron-specific embryonic lethal abnormal vision-4 (ELAV4) have gained increasing attention due to their roles in synaptic plasticity, neuroinflammation, and mRNA stability. This review discusses the potential for targeting the PKC-ELAV4 axis to manage dementia. PKC isoforms, including PKC α, δ, and ε, are involved in amyloid-beta (Aβ) processing, tau phosphorylation, and regulation of mitochondrial activities, whereas ELAV4 stabilizes mRNAs that participate in both the degradation of Aβ (e.g., neprilysin) and the synthesis of Aβ (e.g., beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1, BACE1). We reviewed 75 papers published over the last 15 years using search terms such as neuroinflammation, synaptic plasticity, mRNA stability in dementia, ELAV, ELAV4, PKC, and PKC isoforms in databases including PubMed, WOS, and Google Scholar. Results were summarized, compared, and research gaps were identified during data collection and interpretation. ELAV4 can influence the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP), the precursor of the amyloid-beta peptide, a hallmark of AD. Decreased expression of ELAV4 in the hippocampus is associated with dementia. PKC-δ activates c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) expression, releases Beclin-1 from the Bcl2/Beclin-1 complex, and promotes autophagy. Oxidative stress and PKC η regulate the mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, leading to tau phosphorylation and neuronal death. PKCε activators and ELAV4 inhibitors have positive effects on cognitive function and dementia management by inhibiting neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis, while PKC α, β, δ inhibitors may aid in managing different forms of dementia. This review highlights research gaps and proposes future directions for targeting the PKC-ELAV4 axis as a novel strategy in dementia management."
41604235,"Neuroimmune Cross-Talk and Multilevel Cascades in Fentanyl Toxicity: Interplay of Hypoxic Stress, Glial Activation, and Synaptic Dysregulation in Systems-Level Neurodegeneration.","Fentanyl, an ultra-potent synthetic opioid, has traditionally been characterized by its acute toxic effects, particularly respiratory depression. However, accumulating research indicates that its neurobiological influence extends far beyond its short pharmacological window, intersecting with several core mechanisms implicated in major neurodegenerative disorders. This review integrates multiscale evidence to propose a unified conceptual framework in which fentanyl may function not only as an acute neurotoxin but also as a putative accelerator of long-term neurodegenerative vulnerability. Drawing from molecular signaling, cellular stress pathways, glial-neuronal cross-talk, neurovascular regulation, synaptic architecture, and large-scale neural networks, we highlight fentanyl's capacity to trigger a convergent cascade encompassing hypoxic-metabolic reprogramming, mitochondrial fragmentation, TLR4-NF-κB-driven inflammation, NLRP3 inflammasome activation, complement-mediated synaptic pruning, astrocytic EAAT2 downregulation, and blood-brain barrier compromise. These alterations propagate through recursive cross-talk loops that progressively diminish neuronal resilience, destabilize oscillatory coherence, and weaken circuit-level adaptability. Importantly, mechanistic overlaps with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis suggest that fentanyl exposure may be mechanistically associated with processes capable of accelerating disease onset, exacerbating progression, or unmasking latent vulnerabilities, particularly in genetically or metabolically predisposed individuals. By reframing fentanyl as a systems-level destabilizer capable of imprinting persistent neurobiological changes, this model underscores the need for comprehensive biomarker development, longitudinal risk assessment, and targeted neuroprotective interventions. The integrative framework presented herein offers a foundation for predicting the long-term neurological consequences of fentanyl exposure and calls for urgent reconsideration of its role in population-level neurodegenerative risk."
41604588,Griess's Reagent-Based Azo Compounds Ameliorate Multifaceted Toxicity and Ferroptosis in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and a growing public health concern globally due to the lack of effective treatments. The primary pathological characteristics of AD include the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) as extracellular senile plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) of hyperphosphorylated tau. Additionally, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation are implicated in the disease's pathogenesis. Developing therapeutic approaches to target multiple pathways or disease routes to address the complex pathological processes driven by Aβ remains challenging. In this context, multifunctional small molecules present a promising therapeutic strategy to address the multiple etiologies of AD. In this study, we designed and synthesized a series of multifunctional azo compounds (ACs) based on Griess's reagent. These compounds modulate amyloid aggregation, suppress oxidative stress, mitigate mitochondrial damage, and provide neuroprotection against Aβ-induced toxicity. Among the ACs, <b>AC5</b> effectively prevents Aβ-induced ROS generation, as indicated by Nrf2 translocation, and exhibits anti-inflammatory activity by targeting inflammatory mediators, suppressing induced nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression, and reducing nitric oxide (NO) generation. Furthermore, <b>AC5</b> effectively combats ferroptosis via modulating lipid peroxidation and restores the master regulator Gpx4 activity. Our findings suggest that <b>AC5</b> is a promising therapeutic candidate for addressing the multifaceted pathogenesis of AD."
41609011,"Novel Variants Identified in Families With SNX27-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder, Aiding in Characterizing Its Genotypic and Phenotypic Spectrum.","Sorting Nexin 27 (SNX27), a key regulator of synaptic receptor trafficking and endosomal recycling, has been implicated in maintaining synaptic homeostasis and cognitive function. To date, variants in SNX27 have been reported in a small number of patients across three publications with severe neurodevelopmental phenotypes. However, the genetic and functional landscape of SNX27-related disorders remains poorly understood, and further evidence is needed to confirm its association with disease and to better delineate the associated phenotype. Two unrelated Pakistani families with a total of five affected individuals segregating a neurodevelopmental disorder were investigated via exome or genome sequencing. This revealed a novel homozygous frameshift variant in family I [NM_001330723.2: c.75dup; p. (Ser26Valfs*85)], predicted to be targeted by nonsense-mediated decay. In family II, a novel homozygous missense variant [NM_001330723.2: c.929 T>C; p. (Met310Thr)] was found within the FERM-like region of the SNX27 protein, which is critical for retromer complex interaction. Comparison of five cases described in this study with previously reported six cases reinforces the presence of consistent ""core"" clinical features-global developmental delay, intellectual disability, speech delay, behavioral abnormalities, seizures, and motor dysfunction in all assessed cases. Other features such as dental anomalies, failure to thrive, and dysmorphisms occurred variably in few. Affected individuals with predicted loss-of-function variants typically presented with a more severe phenotype. Thus, core features of SNX27-related neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are intellectual disability, developmental, and speech delays. This study, alongside prior reports, augments the genetic and phenotypic spectrum of SNX27-associated NDDs. The novel frameshift variant p.(Ser26Valfs*85) is predicted to severely disrupt SNX27 function, causing profound neurodevelopmental impairment, whereas the missense p.(Met310Thr) in the FERM-like region is associated with a milder phenotype. Comparative analyses with previous reports reveal a spectrum from early lethality to long-term survival with intellectual disability in SNX27-linked families. These findings underscore the importance of SNX27 in neurodevelopment and further validate its link to a neurodevelopmental disorder."
41608471,The role of the endocannabinoid system in managing neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease.,"The endocannabinoid system comprises cannabinoid receptors (CBRs) 1 & 2, endocannabinoids (eCBs) anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), and the enzymes that regulate their production and degradation. ECS plays a significant role in both health and disease. It influences neuronal and glial communications, neurotransmitter regulations, neuroinflammation, and behavioral alterations. Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are commonly seen in neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer's disease (AD), apart from the core clinical diagnosis of dementia. NPS consists of various disturbing symptoms, including anxiety, agitation, apathy, hallucinations, delusions, sleeping problems, appetite problems, and depression. In AD, up to 97% exhibit one or more NPS. Emerging evidence from preclinical and clinical studies suggests that ECS is both a contributor to and a potential therapeutic target for managing NPS. This review explores ECS's role in NPS and its therapeutic implications."
41605352,Associations of mental and behavioral disorders due to tobacco and alcohol use with incident dementia.,"While smoking and drinking are known to influence cognitive function, the future risk of incident dementia among individuals diagnosed with mental and behavioral disorders due to tobacco use (MBT) and mental and behavioral disorders due to alcohol use (MBA) remains unclear. Data were sourced from the UK Biobank, a publicly accessible database in the United Kingdom. The analysis included 362,934 participants free of dementia at baseline. MBT and MBA were identified using ICD-10 codes from first occurrence data in the UK Biobank dataset. Dementia outcomes, defined algorithmically by the UK Biobank, included all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and vascular dementia. Cox regression models assessed the associations of MBT and MBA with incident dementia. Among only smoking participants, those with MBT had an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.47 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.10-1.96) for all-cause dementia, compared with non-MBT participants. Among only drinking participants, those with MBA had an adjusted HR of 2.34 (95% CI: 2.05-2.68) for all-cause dementia, compared with non-MBA participants. Among both smoking and drinking participants, those with both MBT and MBA (HR = 3.86, 95% CI: 2.78-5.35), those with only MBT (HR = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.02-1.67), and those with only MBA (HR = 2.46, 1.39-4.35) had a significantly higher risk of incident dementia, compared with non-MBT and non-MBA participants. Individuals diagnosed with MBT, MBA, or both are associated with a higher likelihood of incident dementia. These findings underscore the need for interventions targeting these behaviors to mitigate the dementia incidence."
41603334,Towards the development of a management protocol for subjective cognitive decline: Insights from a cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of multimodal data from a memory clinic.,"BackgroundSubjective cognitive decline (SCD) represents the first early symptomatic stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD).ObjectiveWe aimed to investigate the relationships between features in SCD and to assess the importance of these features in the future development of dementia to inform a targeted management protocol.Methods440 SCD patients underwent neurological and neuropsychological assessments, MRI scans, <i>APOE</i> genotyping, and AD biomarker evaluations. Patients were followed for a median of 10 years. Relationships among features were first assessed univariately, focusing on differences across stratified subgroups. To capture multivariate associations, we applied network analysis using a Markov Random Field. Finally, baseline features were related to dementia progression using an XGboost machine learning model.ResultsWomen comprising 68.9% of the cohort, were generally younger at onset, had lower <i>APOE</i> ε4 prevalence, and differed in neuropsychological performance compared to men. Older patients (age >60) exhibited a higher prevalence of <i>APOE</i> ε4 and cerebral small vessel disease. Patients with depressive symptoms demonstrated lower cognitive performance across multiple domains. Network analysis indicated complex interconnections among gender, cognitive reserve, SCD severity, and depressive symptoms. The XGboost model achieved 74% accuracy in predicting progression to dementia, identifying age at onset, mini-mental state examination scores, and <i>APOE</i> genotype as the most predictive factors.ConclusionsThis study highlights the role of age, gender, <i>APOE</i> genotype, and depressive symptoms in the presentation and progression of cognitive decline. By identifying key predictive features, we propose a personalized management protocol aimed at optimizing care for individuals with SCD.<b>Trial registration number:</b> NCT05569083, registration date: 2019-05-30."
41597376,ExoBDNF Probiotic Supplementation Enhances Cognition in Subjective Cognitive Decline.,"<i>Background and Objectives</i>: Interventions targeting the gut-brain axis offer potential for mitigating Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD), a critical window for Alzheimer's prevention. This study evaluated the effects of a novel probiotic supplement, ExoBDNF, on cognitive function, sleep, and emotional distress in adults with SCD. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: In this 9-week open-label study, participants received ExoBDNF supplementation. Efficacy was assessed using the SCD-Questionnaire (SCD-Q), DASS-21, PSQI, MoCA, and a computerized cognitive battery measuring inhibition (Go/No-Go), flexibility (Task Switching), and working memory. <i>Results</i>: Post-intervention analyses revealed significant improvements in subjective cognition (SCD-Q, <i>p</i> < 0.001), sleep quality (PSQI, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and emotional distress (DASS-21, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Objective cognitive performance also improved, with significant gains in MoCA scores (<i>p</i> = 0.047) and executive function metrics. Spearman correlation analysis indicated a significant link between cognitive and emotional changes: longitudinal reductions in SCD scores correlated with concurrent reductions in emotional distress (rho = 0.471, <i>p</i> = 0.009). Furthermore, higher baseline SCD scores predicted greater improvement in emotional outcomes (rho = -0.540, <i>p</i> = 0.002). <i>Conclusions</i>: ExoBDNF supplementation significantly enhanced cognitive performance, sleep quality, and emotional well-being. The findings demonstrate that improvements in subjective cognition are closely tied to alleviated emotional distress, supporting the gut-brain axis as a viable therapeutic target for early-stage cognitive decline."
41596530,FDA-Approved Passive Immunization Treatments Against Aβ in Alzheimer's Disease: Where Are We Now?,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder marked by decreased amyloid-beta (Aβ) clearance, enhanced Aβ aggregation, an increased risk of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), and blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction. The <i>APOE4</i> allele, being the leading genetic risk factor for AD, contributes strongly to these symptoms. This review covers the relationship between <i>APOE4</i> status and the efficacy of FDA-approved monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapies, namely aducanumab, lecanemab, and donanemab. Across several clinical trials, <i>APOE4</i> carriers exhibited higher rates of ARIA-E and ARIA-H compared to non-carriers. While the therapies did often meet biomarker endpoints (i.e., reduced amyloid), benefits were only observed in early and mild AD, and cognitive benefits were often marginal. Going forward, experimental apoE4-targeted immunotherapies may ease the burden of <i>APOE4</i>-related pathology. The field is shifting towards a more integrated approach, focusing on earlier interventions, biomarker-driven precision treatment, and improved drug delivery systems, such as subcutaneous injections, receptor-mediated transport, and antibodies with enhanced BBB penetration. As it stands, high treatment costs, limited accessibility, and strict eligibility criteria all stand as barriers to treatment. By integrating the <i>APOE4</i> genotype into treatment planning and focusing on disease-stage-specific approaches, a safer and more effective means of treating AD could be achieved."
41596136,Natural Vitamins and Novel Synthetic Antioxidants Targeting Mitochondria in Cognitive Health: A Scoping Review of In Vivo Evidence.,"Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are crucial contributors to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia exhibiting cognitive decline at the early stage of neurodegeneration. Natural vitamin antioxidants (NVAs) and novel mitochondria-targeted antioxidants (MTAs) are proposed as potential therapeutics though conclusive evidence is lacking. Objectives were to examine in vivo evidence on NVAs and MTAs for preventing and/or treating cognitive decline leading to dementia, to identify the most promising antioxidants, and highlight translational gaps. Methods followed PRISMA-ScR guidelines. MEDLINE, EMBASE and Scopus were searched for English language in vivo experiments assessing NVAs or MTAs in AD and dementia. A total of 25 studies (13 NVAs; 12 MTAs) met inclusion criteria. NVAs (Vitamin A, B, C, E) demonstrated mixed efficacy in reducing oxidative stress and improving cognitive outcomes, with Vitamin E showing the most consistent neuroprotective effects. MTAs (MitoQ, MitoTEMPO, SS31, SkQ1) improved mitochondrial dynamics and cognitive performance and reduced dementia-related pathology. Both NVAs and MTAs improved biomarker profiles and cognitive outcomes in vivo animal models of AD and dementia, but MTAs showed more robust and consistent efficacy by directly targeting mitochondrial pathways. Given the favourable safety profiles of MTAs in other clinical conditions, early-phase human trials in dementia and AD are warranted to evaluate their long-term cognitive benefits."
41589495,Enzymatic Biomarkers for Early Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease: Uncovering Key Targets and Mechanisms.,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neuronal illness that disrupts behavior, cognitive, and functional abilities. The development of AD is progressive, continuous, and irreversible, from preclinical illness to mild cognitive or even behavioral disturbance to dementia (a medical brain condition) triggered by AD. Worldwide accepted hypotheses of AD are called the amyloid-cascade and hyperphosphorylated tau-cascade hypotheses, and enzymes are implicated in the pathophysiology of AD directly or indirectly. There is an implication of enzymes in the pathophysiology of AD. Enzymes include proteases (e.g., neprilysin), kinases (e.g., glycogen synthase kinase-3), cholinergic enzymes (e.g., acetylcholinesterase), metalloproteinases (e.g., matrix metalloproteinases), and oxidative stress-related enzymes (e.g., superoxide dismutase). However, during abnormal or early Alzheimer's Disease (AD) conditions, the activity and expression of these enzymes are altered in biological samples such as blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in patients with early AD when examined. These alterations in enzyme activity in early AD demonstrate the potential of these enzymes as biomarkers. Early detection of AD in its early stages is crucial for effective control and treatment of the disease. Existing diagnostic techniques rely mainly on neuroimaging and medical evaluation. Through this technique, we can only diagnose the advanced or late stage of AD. Therefore, there is a crucial need to establish valid biomarkers that might assist in the early detection of AD. Enzymatic targets have come to light as a promising alternative for the development of selective and sensitive diagnostic assays. This review aims to investigate the potential of enzymes as an enzymatic target for early AD diagnosis, emphasizing their diagnostic use and fundamental mechanisms. Here, we summarize the role or implication of 25 enzymes in the pathophysiology of AD in the early stage."
41605321,Inclisiran Attenuates Alzheimer's Disease-like Changes by Suppressing Microvascular Endothelial Ferroptosis to Preserve Blood-Brain Barrier Integrity.,"The integrity of blood-brain barrier (BBB) plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by regulating Aβ clearance and neurotoxic compound exclusion. Hyperlipidemia exacerbates AD by impairing the BBB function. Inclisiran, a PCSK9-targeting siRNA, reduces cholesterol levels; however, its neuroprotective effects remain unclear. Here, we report the novel discovery that Inclisiran attenuates AD-like changes through the PCSK9-ferroptosis axis in brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs). First, integrated bioinformatics analysis and experimental validation of cortical tissues from patients with AD and healthy controls revealed a coordinated upregulation of PCSK9 and β-amyloid (Aβ), accompanied by increased iron deposition and significant activation of the ferroptosis pathway. Interestingly, these changes are located in the BMECs of the blood-brain barrier rather than in the brain parenchyma. Second, in hyperlipidemic ApoE-/- mouse models, integrated application of cerebral microvessel isolation, molecular biology techniques, immunofluorescence co-localization analysis, and behavioral tests demonstrated that Inclisiran significantly reduced AD-like changes by attenuating BBB dysfunction based on the suppression of PCSK9-mediated ferroptosis in BMECs. Third, in vitro studies employing the HCMEC/D3 BBB model with integrated assessments of lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial function, and transwell-based barrier integrity demonstrated that Inclisiran significantly reduced ferroptosis and restored BBB integrity via PCSK9 suppression. Our findings not only establish a novel PCSK9-ferroptosis-BBB regulatory axis in AD pathogenesis but also posit the clinically approved lipid-lowering drug, Inclisiran, as a promising therapeutic candidate for AD, providing new targets and mechanisms for the prevention and treatment of AD."
41595750,Beyond Amyloid: Targeting Co-Aggregating Proteins and Targeted Degradation Strategies in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves a constellation of molecular processes that extend well beyond amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation. Recent anti-amyloid antibodies provide limited clinical benefits, highlighting the need for additional strategies due to their modest efficacy and safety concerns. Increasing proteomic evidence reveals that proteins such as midkine (MDK), pleiotrophin (PTN) and clusterin (CLU) accumulate within amyloid plaques and may shape disease progression, although their precise contributions-protective, pathogenic, or both-remain unknown. In this Perspective, we examine how emerging targeted protein degradation (TPD) technologies, including Proteolysis-Targeting Chimeras (PROTACs), Lysosome-Targeting Chimeras (LYTACs) and molecular glues (MGs), could provide a means to selectively eliminate these co-aggregating proteins. We also discuss advances in degrader design, artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted screening, and strategies aimed at enhancing Central Nervous System (CNS) delivery. We finally outline how integrating TPD modalities with antibody-based and multi-target therapeutic approaches may promote more effective, systems-level interventions for AD."
41608987,Multi-platform integration of brain and CSF proteomes reveals biomarker panels for Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia and represents a progressive, irreversible neurodegenerative disorder. Given the complexity and heterogeneity of AD, which involves numerous interrelated molecular pathways, large-scale proteomics datasets are essential for robust biomarker discovery. Comprehensive proteomic profiling enables the unbiased identification of novel biomarkers across diverse biological processes, thereby increasing the likelihood of finding sensitive and specific candidates for early diagnosis and therapeutic targeting. In this study, we analyzed 28 large-scale proteomics datasets obtained from the AD Knowledge Portal and published studies. The data comprise tandem mass tag, label-free quantification, and proximity extension assay measurements from brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid. To enhance analytical power, we integrated these proteomic profiles with corresponding clinical information to construct comprehensive feature sets for subsequent machine learning analysis. Using Random Forest and Logistic Regression models, we identified a panel of proteins capable of distinguishing AD patients from healthy controls. Several of these biomarkers have been previously validated in the context of AD, while others represent novel candidates not yet reported as AD-associated. These newly identified biomarkers warrant further experimental validation and hold promise for improving early diagnosis as well as guiding the development of targeted therapies for AD."
41572619,Comprehensive profiling of Aβ40 and Aβ42 fibril-interacting proteins reveals PRKCG as a drug-targetable regulator of amyloidogenesis in Alzheimer's disease.,"Proteins interacting with amyloid beta (Aβ) fibrils could be key to plaque formation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and represent potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Previous proteomic studies using microdissected plaques might have captured non-specific components rather than true Aβ interactors. Biotinylated Aβ40 or Aβ42 peptides were induced to form fibrils, with Scrambled peptides as controls, and incubated with protein extracts from AD and control prefrontal cortex tissue. Pull-down assays coupled with label-free proteomics identified fibril interactors. Dysregulation and localization were assessed by Western blot, immunofluorescence, immunocytochemistry, immunohistochemistry, and in silico analyses. We identified 185 Aβ40- and 874 Aβ42-associated proteins, with 78 shared. Sixteen proteins, including protein kinase C gamma type (PRKCG), displaying altered expression in AD, were validated as actual interactors and plaque components ex vivo. Remarkably, modulation of PRKCG influenced fibril formation. This study expands the Aβ plaque-associated proteome, identifies novel interactors, and highlights PRKCG as a drug-targetable regulator of AD amyloidogenesis. A comprehensive proteomic profiling allowed identifying proteins interacting with Aβ40 and Aβ42 fibrils, including many novel interactors. Sixteen proteins were validated in vitro and ex vivo as bona fide Aβ plaque constituents. Dysregulated expression of key interactors was confirmed in AD brain and cell models. Modulation of PRKCG activity altered Aβ fibril formation and progression. Findings expand the Aβ-associated proteome and highlight novel targets for AD biomarker and therapeutic development."
41603025,Nanomaterial strategies for mitigating protein misfolding and neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative diseases.,"Neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease are characterized by pathological protein misfolding, persistent neuroinflammation, and progressive synaptic deterioration. Nanoscale therapeutic platforms offer a versatile strategy for simultaneously suppressing pathogenic protein aggregation and modulating glial hyperactivation, thereby addressing the multifactorial nature of neurodegenerative pathology. Engineered AuNPs, carbon-based nanodots, and related constructs with negatively charged surfaces exhibit high affinity for amyloidogenic peptides, thereby limiting amyloid-β or tau fibrillization, while photothermal strategies using graphene or gold nanorods induce localized thermal disruption of preformed aggregates, enhancing their disassembly. In parallel, functionalized nanocarriers facilitate brain-targeted delivery of anti-inflammatory agents by leveraging receptor-mediated transcytosis or biomimetic cell membrane-camouflaging strategies, attenuating proinflammatory cytokines and promoting autophagic clearance. <i>In vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> models demonstrate integrated therapeutic benefits, including attenuation of plaque deposition, preservation of neuronal integrity, and recovery of cognitive performance. Despite remaining challenges in large-scale synthesis and long-term safety, evolving nanotechnologies offer a flexible and integrated platform capable of disrupting the pathogenic cycle linking protein misfolding, neuroinflammation, and disease progression."
41602207,"Merging multimodal digital biomarkers into ""Digital Neuro Fingerprints"" for precision neurology in dementias: the promise of the right treatment for the right patient at the right time in the age of AI.","Digital biomarkers are revolutionizing medicine in ways that were unimaginable a few years ago. Consequently, precision medicine approaches now realistically can promise personalization, i.e., the right treatments for the right patients at the right time, including earlier, targeted interventions which lead to a major paradigm shift in how medicine is practiced from reactive to preventive action. Although the scientific evidence is clear on the power of digital biomarkers, there is an unmet need for translating these findings into actionable insights in clinical practice. In this paper, we focus on Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), and how digital biomarkers could empower clinical decision making in its preclinical stages. We argue that a new all-encompassing score is needed, akin to a BrainHealth Index linked to the established and validated risk stratifications frameworks and is directed at the prevention of ADRD. Specifically, we propose the new concept ""Digital Neuro Fingerprint (DNF)"", built with simultaneous collection of multimodal digital biomarkers (speech, gait, eye movements etc.) from smartphone based augmented reality or virtual reality while an individual is immersed in activities of daily living. Fusing the captured multimodal digital biomarkers, data is automatically analyzed with custom combinations of machine- and deep-learning approaches and enhanced with explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) and uncertainty quantifications. We argue that DNF is useful for capturing ADRD progression and should supersede the biomarkers that are invasive and expensive to obtain, offering a sensitive and highly specific score that measures meaningful aspects of health for the patients in high-frequency intervals."
41594549,Advances in Bioactive Compounds from Plants and Their Applications in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), the leading cause of dementia worldwide, is characterized by progressive neuronal loss, amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregation, tau hyperphosphorylation, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, cholinergic dysfunction, and gut-brain axis dysregulation. Despite advances in anti-amyloid therapeutics, current interventions provide only modest symptomatic relief and face limitations in accessibility, cost, and long-term efficacy. Plant-derived bioactive compounds, rooted in traditional medicine systems such as Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine, have gained increasing attention as multi-target therapeutic agents due to their pleiotropic actions, relative safety, and ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. This review synthesizes mechanistic and translational evidence on major phytochemicals, including withanolides (<i>Withania somnifera</i>), curcumin (<i>Curcuma longa</i>), ginkgolides and bilobalide (<i>Ginkgo biloba</i>), bacosides (<i>Bacopa monnieri</i>), ginsenosides (<i>Panax ginseng</i>), crocin/safranal (<i>Crocus sativus</i>), epigallocatechin-3-gallate (<i>Camellia sinensis</i>), rosmarinic acid (<i>Salvia officinalis</i>, <i>Melissa officinalis</i>), and asiaticosides (<i>Centella asiatica</i>). These compounds exert neuroprotective effects by inhibiting Aβ aggregation, reducing tau phosphorylation, scavenging reactive oxygen species, attenuating NF-κB-mediated inflammation, modulating cholinergic signaling, enhancing synaptic plasticity via brain-derived neurotrophic factor/cAMP response element-binding protein (BDNF/CREB) activation, and regulating gut microbiota. Multi-target approach analyses underscore their synergistic potential in targeting interconnected AD pathways. However, translation remains hindered by poor oral bioavailability, rapid metabolism, and variability in clinical outcomes. Advances in delivery platforms, including liposomes, bilosomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, and nanostructured lipid carriers, are improving stability, blood-brain penetration, and therapeutic efficacy in preclinical models. Collectively, plant-derived phytochemicals serve as promising, affordable, and multi-modal candidates for reshaping AD management, bridging traditional knowledge with modern therapeutic innovation."
41588589,Evaluation of the Combined Therapeutic Potential of Turmeric and Donepezil on the Cholinergic System in a Mouse Model of AD-like Pathology.,"The multifactorial pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) makes effective prevention and treatment challenging. Integrative medicine presents a promising approach by complementing conventional treatments with neuroprotective nutraceuticals. This study investigates the individual and combinatorial effects of turmeric, a neuroprotective herb, and donepezil, an acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor, on cognitive functions in a scopolamine-induced amnesic mouse model. Molecular interactions of curcuminoids and donepezil with AChE were analyzed using AutoDock Vina and AMBER22. In animal model studies, amnesia was induced in BALB/c mice via subcutaneous injections of scopolamine (1mg/kg/day) for a duration of 25 days. From the 11th day onwards, the turmeric rhizome powder (20mg/kg/day) and donepezil (0.5mg/kg/day) were orally administered as monotherapies or in combination. Cognitive functions were assessed through behavior tests. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations revealed that curcuminoids (curcumin, bisdemethoxycurcumin, and desmethoxycurcumin) inhibited AChE more effectively than donepezil. Animal studies demonstrated significant enhancements in spatial, reference, recognition, and contextual fear memories, with both turmeric and donepezil monotherapies, and their combination therapy. No significant differences were observed between monotherapies, and no additive effect was evident in the combination therapy. Co-administration of turmeric and donepezil did not yield a significant additive effect on cognitive improvement in scopolamine-induced amnesic mice. Turmeric monotherapy showed cognitive improvements comparable to those of donepezil monotherapy, highlighting its potential as a candidate therapy for donepezil-resistant AD. Turmeric monotherapy improved cognitive performance similarly to donepezil monotherapy in scopolamine-induced amnesic mice. These preliminary findings require further research, including dose optimization and clinical trials, to establish their clinical relevance."
41568664,Engineering nanobodies for drug delivery systems in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a major global health challenge, with current therapies offering only symptomatic relief. A significant constraint in the development of effective treatments is the blood-brain barrier (BBB), as it greatly limits the access of therapeutic drugs targeting amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregation, tau hyperphosphorylation and neuroinflammation. Nanobodies, single-domain antibody fragments derived from camelids, have emerged as versatile tools with unique properties such as small size, high stability and the ability to penetrate the BBB. Engineered formats allow for specific targeting of Aβ and tau, receptor-mediated transcytosis, and conjugation with therapeutic or diagnostic substances. Preclinical studies show that nanobody-based strategies can reduce pathological burden, attenuate neuroinflammation and improve cognitive outcomes in AD models. Manufacturing scale-up, long-term safety and regulatory validation are among the remaining challenges, yet nanobody engineering represents a viable path to disease-modifying medicines. Innovative approaches, including artificial intelligence-driven design, i.e. 4-1BB agonist nanobodies, and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat-facilitated diversification of nanobody libraries - such as targeted complementarity-determining region 3 mutagenesis followed by functional screening against disease-relevant tau or Aβ conformers - alongside half-life extension strategies, are commencing to surmount these obstacles and enhance the potential of nanobody platforms to develop into clinically viable disease-modifying therapies."
41602154,Role of FK506 binding protein 51 in central nervous system diseases.,"FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP51) is a pivotal molecular chaperone and scaffolding protein that integrates and modulates multiple signaling pathways-including those involving HSP90, the glucocorticoid receptor, AKT, and NF-κB-through its FK1, FK2, and TPR domains, thereby playing a central role in the maintenance of central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis. This review systematically elaborates on the pathological mechanisms and therapeutic potential of FKBP51 in a variety of CNS disorders. In neurodegenerative diseases, FKBP51 promotes aberrant aggregation of Tau protein via the HSP90 complex, exacerbating the pathological progression of Alzheimer's disease; in Parkinson's disease, it influences neuronal survival through interaction with the PINK1/AKT signaling pathway; while in Huntington's disease, it impairs the clearance of mutant huntingtin (mHTT) protein. In models of ischemic stroke, upregulation of FKBP51 enhances autophagy and inflammatory responses through pathways such as AKT/FoxO3, thereby amplifying brain injury. In glioma, FKBP51 exhibits a context-dependent dual role: it may exert tumor-suppressive effects by inhibiting Akt, while its splice variant FKBP51s can regulate PD-L1 expression, promoting tumor immune evasion and therapy resistance. Emerging highly selective small-molecule inhibitors, gene-editing technologies, and novel applications of conventional drugs targeting FKBP51 have demonstrated significant interventional potential in preclinical studies. In summary, FKBP51 constitutes a pleiotropic signaling node, positioning it as a prime therapeutic target for a broad spectrum of CNS disorders."
41588888,Advances in Nose-to-Brain Delivery Systems for Effective Alzheimer's Disease Management.,"Neurodegenerative diseases comprise a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by the progressive structural and functional deterioration of neurons in the central nervous system. Among them, Alzheimer's disease is the most prevalent worldwide. Despite their distinct clinical manifestations, many neurodegenerative disorders share convergent pathophysiological mechanisms such as protein misfolding and aggregation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation, which ultimately drive neuronal loss. These processes lead to profound impairments in cognitive performance, motor coordination, and overall functional capacity, making such diseases exceptionally difficult to diagnose early and manage effectively. Traditional treatment approaches administered orally or parenterally face limitations, including high hepatic metabolism, poor penetration across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and systemic side effects. This review highlights the potential of the nose-to-brain (N2B) delivery system as an emerging and promising therapeutic strategy. N2B delivery utilizes the olfactory and trigeminal nerve pathways in the nasal cavity to rapidly and precisely deliver drugs to the central nervous system without crossing the blood-brain barrier. Because the system is non-invasive, it offers high bioavailability, reduced systemic exposure, and improved patient compliance. The use of lipid nanocarriers, nanoparticles, dendrimers, and nanogels to enhance the stability of drugs, facilitating efficient targeting and controlled release, is a crucial factor in optimizing N2B drug delivery systems. Various attributes influence drug transport, which are physiological, physicochemical and formulation-dependent characteristics. The main challenges faced by the N2B delivery system are enzymatic degradation and mucociliary clearance. Emerging technologies, such as AI, 3D Printing, and personalized medicine, all hold promise for future inventions in this area. Preclinical and clinical trials demonstrate the efficacy of delivering N2B in treating neurodegenerative diseases; however, its full potential remains to be seen due to regulatory, safety, and scalability concerns. Hence, this review emphasizes the research required to pursue interdisciplinary collaboration and unlock the full potential of N2B delivery, as well as a new approach to transforming neurodegenerative conditions."
41585699,"Imidazo[1,2‑<i>a</i>]pyridines in Medicinal Chemistry: Recent Advances in Synthesis and Biological Activities.","Imidazo-[1,2-<i>a</i>]-pyridines are widely recognized scaffolds present in several marketed drugs, including the anxiolytics alpidem, saripidem, necopidem, and zolpidem, which are some of the most prescribed medications for insomnia. In this review, we analyze publication trends, which reveal exponential growth in research involving this scaffold. We highlight recent synthetic strategies (2017-2025) for the preparation of imidazo-[1,2-<i>a</i>]-pyridine derivatives, such as condensation, multicomponent and tandem reactions, intramolecular cyclizations, and oxidative couplings under green conditions. In addition, we discuss innovative Medicinal Chemistry studies exploring their applications in the treatment of cancer, Alzheimer's disease, tuberculosis, and neglected tropical diseases. Significant advances have been made in identifying derivatives with potent activity against specific biological targets, including kinases, tubulin, HDACs, the cytochrome bc1 complex of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>, and key enzymes involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, such as cholinesterases and secretases. Altogether, this review consolidates the vast therapeutic potential of the imidazo-[1,2-<i>a</i>]-pyridine core, emphasizing its synthetic versatility and broad spectrum of biological activities, which firmly establish it as a privileged scaffold for drug discovery."
41603341,An integrative multi-omics study reveals glutamine metabolism dysregulation connecting Alzheimer's disease and age-related macular degeneration.,"BackgroundAlzheimer's disease (AD) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) are two common neurodegenerative diseases with many similar pathological features, but their shared metabolic characteristics have not been fully elucidated.ObjectiveThis study aims to explore the shared metabolic pathways between AD and AMD using an integrated multi-omics strategy.MethodsWe incorporated Mendelian randomization (MR), bulk and single-cell transcriptomics, and targeted metabolomics to investigate the metabolic links.ResultsThrough MR, we found elevated genetically inferred glutamine concentrations were correlated with a lower likelihood of AD but a higher likelihood of AMD. Using transcriptomic profiling, we detected 19 common differentially expressed genes associated with glutamine and glutamate metabolism, such as GLS. Analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data revealed that GLS displays distinct cell-type expression patterns. Targeted metabolomic profiling in APP/PS1 mice at 5 months of age provided additional evidence for alterations in glutamine metabolism. The degree of metabolic changes in the eyes was higher than that in the cortex and hippocampus, and the prominent eyes may be an early indicator of neurodegenerative metabolic dysfunction.ConclusionsOverall, these findings suggest that glutamine metabolism disorders represent a convergent mechanism between AD and AMD. Our findings shed light on the overlapping metabolic pathways linking AD and AMD, underscoring the value of ocular biomarkers as promising tools for early disease detection."
41603996,Redox signaling in the heart and brain: the roles of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species in disease and therapy.,"Nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are central to the pathophysiology of cardiovascular and neurological disorders, influencing intricate signaling pathways that manage vascular function, inflammation, and oxidative stress. NO, predominantly produced by NO-synthases, plays a vital role in maintaining vascular health by facilitating vasodilation and preventing platelet aggregation. However, its reaction with superoxide results in the formation of peroxynitrite, a highly reactive molecule that intensifies oxidative damage and impairs endothelial function. Elevated ROS levels, arising from sources like NADPH oxidases and mitochondrial activity, further heighten oxidative stress, driving the progression of conditions like atherosclerosis and neurodegenerative diseases. Therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring the balance between NO and ROS include the use of antioxidants to neutralize ROS, pharmacological methods to enhance NO bioavailability, and nanoparticle-based systems designed to address oxidative stress. Emerging research points to potential of targeting redox-sensitive pathways, such as the Keap1-Nrf2 axis, to slow disease progression. In neurological disorders, overproduction of ROS leads to neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis, which are central to conditions like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. This review explores the complex relationship between NO and ROS in disease mechanisms, emphasizing cutting-edge therapeutic strategies that utilize redox signaling in cardiovascular and neurological conditions."
41604675,Structure-Based Virtual Screening Identifies TREM2-Targeted Small Molecules that Enhance Microglial Phagocytosis.,"Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is a microglia-specific receptor whose activation promotes phagocytosis and neuroprotection in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related neurodegenerative disorders. While therapeutic efforts have largely focused on antibodies, small-molecule TREM2 modulators remain limited. Here, we applied a structure-based virtual screening workflow targeting a putative allosteric site on TREM2, guided by PyRod-derived pharmacophores from molecular dynamics simulations. Screening of the Enamine Collection (ESC) yielded 20 candidate compounds, three of which demonstrated binding in TRIC assays. The top hit, EN020, exhibited a K<sub>D</sub> of 14.2 µM (MST) and 35.9 µM (SPR), and significantly enhanced microglial phagocytosis in BV2 cells, outperforming the known TREM2 agonist VG-3927. A preliminary structure-activity relationship (SAR) study, including synthetic and catalog-derived analogs, highlighted a narrow tolerance for scaffold modifications, with only T2V002 retaining partial TREM2 binding affinity. This work identifies EN020 as a novel small-molecule TREM2 modulator with functional activity, providing a framework for rational optimization toward potential AD therapeutics."
41601981,Metabolite and gut microbiota co-biomarkers in Danggui Shaoyao San: insights into a shared therapeutic approach.,"Danggui Shaoyao San (DSS), a classical multi-herbal formulation of traditional Chinese medicine, demonstrates therapeutic potential for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), Alzheimer's Disease (AD), and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). This review proposes a unified mechanism whereby DSS exerts its effects by modulating a network of shared pathological biomarkers across these disorders. We identify tryptophan (Trp) and phenylalanine (Phe) as host-derived metabolic biomarkers in plasma, and the gut bacterial phylum Bacteroidetes as a shared gut microbial biomarker. The therapeutic actions of DSS are mediated by its botanical constituents (e.g., ligustilides, paeoniflorin, ferulic acid), which help correct the dysregulated Trp-kynurenine and Phe metabolic pathways, while simultaneously enriching Bacteroidetes to alleviate gut dysbiosis and rebalance the gut-brain axis. This coordinated regulation of shared host metabolic and gut microbial biomarkers provides a scientific rationale for applying DSS as a multi-targeted agent, illustrating a molecular basis for a shared therapeutic approach."
41599225,"Nrf2 Modulation by Natural Compounds in Aging, Neurodegeneration, and Neuropathic Pain.","This review summarizes the role of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) as a common link between aging, neurodegeneration, and neuropathic pain. Aging is characterized by oxidative stress and constant inflammation, which coincides with reduced Nrf2 activity and weaker antioxidant responses, increasing vulnerability to diseases. In neurodegenerative disorders-including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-evidence indicates that impaired Nrf2 signaling contributes to oxidative damage, neuroinflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, in neuropathic pain, similar mechanisms are involved, and Nrf2 could play a role as a potential analgesic target because of its role in regulating cellular defense pathways. We also review natural Nrf2 modulators (e.g., flavonoids, other polyphenols, terpenoids, alkaloids), discussing their benefits alongside common translational limitations such as poor solubility, low oral bioavailability, rapid metabolism, and potential safety issues, including possible pro-oxidant effects and chemoresistance. We also outline future directions that should prioritize improving delivery systems, addressing <i>NRF2/KEAP1</i> gene variations, evaluating combinations with standard therapies, exploring preventive applications, and defining dosing, treatment duration, and long-term safety. Overall, current evidence indicates that Nrf2 modulation is a practical, cross-cutting approach relevant to healthy aging and disease management."
41606651,Proximity labeling in neuroscience: decoding molecular landscapes for precision neurology.,"The intricate cellular architecture and dynamic molecular interplay in the nervous system have long challenged mechanistic studies of neurological diseases. Conventional approaches often miss the transient, low-affinity, or spatially confined interactions that underlie neural homeostasis and pathogenesis. Proximity labeling (PL) technologies overcome this limitation by enabling in situ capture of these elusive molecular events within living systems. Through spatially restricted biotinylation, PL methods, including engineered biotin ligases (e.g., TurboID), peroxidases (e.g., APEX2), and emerging photocatalytic platforms, allow high-resolution mapping of proteomes and interactomes within defined subcellular compartments, cell types, and cell-cell interfaces. In this review, we systematically outline the principles of PL and its transformative applications in constructing molecular atlases of the nervous system. We highlight how these tools are revolutionizing our understanding of brain function by elucidating pathophysiological mechanisms in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and other neurological disorders. Furthermore, we discuss how PL accelerates the translation of basic research into clinical practice by facilitating the discovery of mechanistic biomarkers and druggable targets. Finally, we address current challenges and future directions, including integration with multi-omics and single-cell methodologies, and conclude that PL can advance precision neurology by bridging molecular neurobiology with therapeutic innovation."
41603414,Multi-omic expression of the VEGF family relates to Alzheimer's disease across diverse populations.,"The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling family plays a role in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previous work has shown widespread effects of the members FLT1, FLT4, and VEGFB on AD outcomes. However, these analyses have focused within the non-Hispanic White (NHW) population. The goal of this study was to analyze the effects of the VEGF family in underrepresented populations, leveraging large and diverse bulk RNA sequencing and tandem mass tag-mass spectrometry (TMT-MS) proteomic data. Outcomes included measures of AD pathology and diagnosis. Within underrepresented populations, we replicated previously reported effects of FLT1 and FLT4, whereby higher protein abundance was observed in the AD brain and was associated with higher neuropathology burden. In stratified analyses, these associations were largely consistent across race and ethnicity. This multi-omic study on the role of the VEGF family in AD emphasizes the need for more representative studies focused on therapeutic targets for AD. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) genes and proteins were quantified in four different brain regions. Samples included participants from four different populations. Previously observed effects were replicated in diverse populations. This study is the largest multi-omic study of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) genes among Alzheimer's disease (AD) participants from diverse populations."
41599736,Discontinued BACE1 Inhibitors in Phase II/III Clinical Trials and AM-6494 (Preclinical) Towards Alzheimer's Disease Therapy: Repurposing Through Network Pharmacology and Molecular Docking Approach.,"<b>Background</b>: β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) inhibitors demonstrated amyloid-lowering efficacy but failed in phase II/III clinical trials due to adverse effects and limited disease-modifying outcomes. This study employed an integrated network pharmacology and molecular docking approach to quantitatively elucidate the multitarget mechanisms of 4 (phase II/III) discontinued BACE1 inhibitors (Verubecestat, Lanabecestat, Elenbecestat, and Umibecestat) and the preclinical compound AM-6494 in Alzheimer's disease (AD). <b>Methods</b>: Drug-associated targets were intersected with AD-related genes to construct a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, followed by topological analysis to identify hub proteins. Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses were performed using statistically significant thresholds (<i>p</i> < 0.05, FDR-adjusted). Molecular docking was conducted using AutoDock Vina to quantify binding affinities and interaction modes between the selected compounds and the identified hub proteins. <b>Results</b>: Network analysis identified 10 hub proteins (CASP3, STAT3, BCL2, AKT1, MTOR, BCL2L1, HSP90AA1, HSP90AB1, TNF, and MDM2). GO enrichment highlighted key biological processes, including the negative regulation of autophagy, regulation of apoptotic signalling, protein folding, and inflammatory responses. KEGG pathway analysis revealed significant enrichment in the PI3K-AKT-MTOR signalling, apoptosis, and TNF signalling pathways. Molecular docking demonstrated strong multitarget binding, with binding affinities ranging from approximately -6.6 to -11.4 kcal/mol across the hub proteins. Umibecestat exhibited the strongest binding toward AKT1 (-11.4 kcal/mol), HSP90AB1 (-9.5 kcal/mol), STAT3 (-8.9 kcal/mol), HSP90AA1 (-8.5 kcal/mol), and MTOR (-8.3 kcal/mol), while Lanabecestat showed high affinity for AKT1 (-10.6 kcal/mol), HSP90AA1 (-9.9 kcal/mol), BCL2L1 (-9.2 kcal/mol), and CASP3 (-8.5 kcal/mol), respectively. These interactions were stabilized by conserved hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic contacts, and π-alkyl interactions within key regulatory domains of the target proteins, supporting their multitarget engagement beyond BACE1 inhibition. <b>Conclusions</b>: This study demonstrates that clinically failed BACE1 inhibitors engage multiple non-structural regulatory proteins that are central to AD pathogenesis, particularly those governing autophagy, apoptosis, proteostasis, and neuroinflammation. The identified ligand-hub protein complexes provide a mechanistic rationale for repurposing and optimization strategies targeting network-level dysregulation in Alzheimer's disease, warranting further in silico refinement and experimental validation."
41562905,Current State of the Neurotrophin-Based Pharmaceutics in the Treatment of Neurodegenerative Diseases and Neuroinflammation.,"The regulation of the synthesis of the nerve growth factor and other neurotrophins is one of the dynamically developing areas of pharmacotherapy of neurological and mental disorders. Despite a large number of studies of various ligands of neurotrophin receptors, only a few have reached clinical application and only for ocular diseases. The aim of this narrative review was to systematize the main progress on neurotrophin-based pharmaceutics; to perform a comparative critical analysis of various therapeutic strategies, elucidate the underlying causes of clinical trial failures, and identify the most promising avenues for future development. The literature search was conducted in PubMed, Google Scholar, Medline, and EBSCO, and the ClinicalTrials.gov database was used to track current clinical studies, along with the official websites of pharmaceutical companies. The search covered original studies published up to October 2025, with inclusion restricted to articles published in English. Articles describing specific pharmacological compounds that had reached the clinical trial stage were selected. Foundational biological research was referenced to contextually explain the mechanisms of action of the drugs and their therapeutic implications. Recombinant neurotrophins and synthetic molecules, the agonists and antagonists of their receptors, and cell-based gene therapy are promising means for the prevention and rehabilitation of ischemic conditions, as well as the treatment of neuropathic pain and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Some of these have undergone clinical trials, yet only neurotrophins for ocular diseases have been implemented in clinical practice: recombinant NGF-cenegermin and recombinant CNTF-Revakinagene taroretcel. The success of these eye drugs is likely attributable to their local administration, improved bioavailability, and low ocular immunoresistance. The study identified limitations and future prospects for neurotrophin-based pharmaceuticals. For future clinical trials, attention should be paid to the pharmacogenetic profiles of the patients and the evaluation of the inflammatory status of the disease. Novel plasma biomarkers of the effectiveness are needed as well as TSPO-PET imaging. Drug delivery systems remain insufficient; therefore, efforts should focus on inducing endogenous neurotrophin production and developing highly selective agonists and antagonists of neurotrophin receptors. It is crucial to establish a favorable premorbid background before neurotrophin therapy to minimize immunoresistance."
41596076,Beyond Radical Scavengers: Focus on NADPH Oxidases (NOX) Inhibitors as New Agents for Antioxidant Therapy in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Over the past decade, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation have been increasingly recognized as part of the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This observation has led to extensive efforts and attempts to apply antioxidant compounds as therapeutic agents for AD and other pathologies. However, most, if not all, of these attempts have failed in preclinical or clinical trials. A tentative explanation for this failure is radical scavengers' intrinsic lack of specificity in either their mode or district of action. The lack of specificity has been thought by some to be a source of so-called ""reductive stress"", another form of redox imbalance that might be just as toxic as oxidative stress. Thus, research interest is shifting from developing simple radical scavengers to designing and refining compounds targeting the overproduction of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) in specific pathological conditions. This can be achieved, for instance, by targeting the enzymes that are mainly responsible for their production, namely NADPH oxidases (NOX). In this review, we will discuss, from the point of view of medicinal chemistry, the main innovations in the development of NOX inhibitors and their potential employment for AD therapy. We will also discuss the experimental hurdles that slow down research in this field and possible solutions."
41606102,Strategies for blood-brain barrier rejuvenation and repair.,"Blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction is a hallmark of many diseases of the brain, including those that represent the largest healthcare burden (for example, Alzheimer disease and stroke). Despite this, rejuvenation and repair of the BBB is not a mainstream concept. During life, the BBB is subjected to perturbations and stresses from a wide range of endogenous or exogenous sources, which can promote brain health or can lead to brain pathologies. The BBB supports many functions that are critical for central nervous system homeostasis and so there are many mechanisms of dysfunction, and hence many targets for intervention. Furthermore, many mechanisms are shared among diseases and disease subtypes, resulting in the potential for common strategies for BBB repair. In this Review, we consider the BBB as a therapeutic target and discuss approaches to its repair and protection in specific disease states and during normal ageing."
41609039,Adipose-Derived Stem Cells Transfected to Express Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Reduce Hippocampal Amyloid Plaque Load and Improve Dendritic Morphology in the APP/PS1dE9 Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Recent studies have indicated that stem cells could provide therapeutic benefits in several neurological conditions, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) offer many advantages in that they are readily available from individual hosts, are robust, and secrete many factors that promote neuronal growth and homeostasis. We transfected ADSCs with a viral construct for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and examined the effects of transplanting these cells into the hippocampus of 7-mo-old APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. After 6 mo, the hippocampus was examined for stem-cell survival, effects on BDNF and neprilysin-2 (NEP-2) levels, dendritic morphology using microtubule associated protein 2 (MAP2) immunohistochemistry, and amyloid plaque load. We found that transplanted BDNF-ADSCs had survived after 6 mo. BDNF and NEP-2 levels were higher than sham controls, and dendritic architecture was improved. In addition, amyloid plaque numbers were reduced. BDNF-ADSCs appear to confer benefits by simultaneously enhancing amyloid clearance and promoting neuronal structural repair. This multifaceted approach highlights the potential of engineering stem cells to target multiple pathophysiological hallmarks of AD, positioning BDNF-ADSCs as a powerful and synergistic cell-gene therapy strategy for this devastating disorder."
41565468,Cell type-specific gene regulatory atlas prioritizes drug targets and repurposable medicines in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex and poorly understood neurodegenerative disorder that lacks sufficiently effective treatments. Computational and integrative analyses that leverage multiomics data provide a promising strategy to uncover disease mechanisms and identify therapeutic opportunities. Here, we develop a cell type-specific regulatory atlas of the human middle temporal gyrus via leveraging single-nucleus RNA-seq (1,197,032 nuclei) and ATAC-seq (740,875 nuclei) datasets from 84 donors across four stages of AD neuropathological change (ADNC). We observe differential gene expression for six major cell types intensified at severe ADNC. Integrating peak-to-gene linkages and motif enrichment analyses, we reconstruct transcription factor (TF)-target gene networks across six major brain cell types. By integrating genome-wide association study (GWAS) loci with cell type-specific <i>cis</i>-regulatory DNA elements (CREs), we pinpoint 141 ADNC-associated genes. Using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and network proximity analysis, we further identify nine candidate repurposable drugs that were associated with these ADNC-related genes. In summary, this cell type-specific multiomics atlas provides a comprehensive resource for mechanistic understanding, target prioritization, and therapeutic hypothesis generation in AD and AD-related dementia if broadly applied."
41607671,Six month repeat cognitive testing to identify people with MCI at greatest AD dementia risk.,"People with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are candidates for early intervention, but not all progress to Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. Identifying a subgroup at highest risk may improve treatment targeting. We analyzed data from participants with MCI enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Cognitive domains included memory, executive functioning, language, and visuospatial abilities. We evaluated baseline performance and 6-month change scores, using proportional hazards models to estimate associations with time to conversion to AD dementia. The strength of association varied by domain, but in general both baseline performance and 6-month change were associated with conversion. The strongest effects observed for memory and language. Observed associations were largely independent of established risk biomarkers, including APOE genotype, structural MRI measures, and CSF biomarkers. 6-month change scores on cognitive tests may help identify a high-risk subgroup of persons with MCI likely to progress to AD dementia. Systematic review. The authors reviewed the literature using traditional (e.g. PubMed) sources. There is a modest literature on change scores in the context of the AD clinical spectrum, but few investigations have evaluated whether short-term changes may be able to identify a high-risk subgroup of people with MCI. The authors have published a systematic review of this literature (Jutten et al. 2020) and appropriately refer to relevant citations here.Interpretation: Our findings suggest that short-term changes in cognition may be useful as part of a strategy to identify subsets of people with MCI who are at highest risk of conversion. Findings were clearest for memory and language. Domain-specific changes appeared to be independent from other biomarkers used to identify people at highest risk. Domain-specific changes did not appear to be better than changes in global cognition as measured by the MMSE or the CDR-sum of boxes.Future directions: Short-term changes in cognition may be useful to help identify a subgroup of people with MCI at highest risk of conversion to AD dementia. Future work could consider time frames shorter than the 6-month data we had available, better characterizing changes with more than 2 time points, or developing strategies that combine changes in cognition with other biomarkers to identify a subgroup of people with MCI to target for treatment."
41582778,"Chitosan nanoparticles for brain targeted nose-to-brain drug delivery in neurodegenerative disease: a comprehensive exploration of advances, limitations and future prospects.","Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and epilepsy, cause irreversible nerve cell degradation, resulting in cognitive and motor decline. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) complicates treatment, limiting drug access and causing low bioavailability. Chitosan nanoparticles (CH-NPs) offer a promising solution for improving drug delivery to the brain due to their biocompatibility and ability to enhance intranasal delivery, potentially increasing therapeutic efficacy. The review discusses advancements in chitosan-based nanoparticle drug delivery systems for NDDs, highlighting literature from 2015 to 2025. It indicates that chitosan can improve drug uptake in the brain by up to ten times and emphasizes its potential for targeted central nervous system (CNS) delivery due to its unique properties. Additionally, intranasal delivery is a non-invasive method to bypass the BBB and enhance therapeutic precision. CH-NPs effectively deliver therapeutics to the CNS, leveraging their mucoadhesive properties and biocompatibility to cross the BBB via intranasal delivery. This platform enhances drug uptake and retention in the brain, addressing challenges faced by traditional therapies for NDDs. Optimizing nanoparticle biomaterial properties and delivery methods could improve therapeutic precision and clinical outcomes."
41603393,Neuropsychological subtypes of incident mild cognitive impairment and mild neurocognitive disorder in a population-based cohort of older adults.,"BackgroundMild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a heterogenous condition which places individuals at higher risk for Alzheimer's disease, yet it is not well understood. Studies of primarily prevalent MCI have identified different subtypes characterized by different neuropsychological profiles, while a recent incident MCI study empirically identified four neuropsychological subtypes (amnestic, dysexecutive, dysnomic, and subtle cognitive impairment (SCI) subtypes).ObjectiveWe aimed to identify whether four distinct neuropsychological subtypes could be empirically derived in a sample of a) incident MCI and b) DSM5 mild neurocognitive disorder (mNCD).MethodsWe used data from the Personality and Total Health Through Life study. Participants were aged 72-78, with a diagnosis of incident MCI (n = 117), and/or mNCD (n = 161). We undertook a cross-sectional cluster analysis on neuropsychological data from participants from four domains: executive, memory, language, and visuospatial.ResultsFor incident MCI, cluster analysis derived four subtypes, (dysexecutive, SCI, mixed dysnomic/visuospatial and mixed dysexecutive/visuospatial). For mNCD, the resulting four cluster solution included dysexecutive, SCI-amnestic/dysnomic, SCI-dysexecutive and mixed/global impairment. Discriminant function analysis revealed that 94% and 91% of MCI and mNCD participants respectively were correctly classified based on the cognitive domain scores, and further analysis confirmed the SCI groups showed reduced cognitive performance compared with matched cognitively unimpaired participants.ConclusionsNeuropsychological subtypes were empirically derived in both incident MCI and mild NCD samples, with both SCI and dysexecutive clusters most reliably detected and consistent with previous studies. The early identification of these MCI/mNCD subtypes may help to identify patient groups for targeted early intervention in clinical settings."
41605840,Biomarkers in patients with clinical signs of mild cognitive impairment or mild Alzheimer's disease but without amyloid deposits on positron emission tomography: Results from Bio-Hermes Study participants.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) study participants may present with cognitive impairment who do not have brain amyloid deposits (Aβ-). Identifying predictive biomarkers for non-amyloid-related CI may provide better screening tests for trials seeking only CI Aβ+ participants and new therapy targets. Analysis of the Bio-Hermes biomarker database identified subpopulations of clinically normal, CN Aβ- (n = 313), CI Aβ- (n = 296), and CI Aβ+ (n = 258), and CN Aβ+ (n = 84) participants. Comparative analysis of demographics, clinical assessments, biomarkers, cytokines, and proteomics results was conducted. Subgroup comparison of CI Aβ- versus CN Aβ- found that neurofilament light most clearly differentiated CI Aβ- from CN Aβ- participants. No other biomarker analysis reached a level of differential significance. Analyses showed many novel biomarkers do not differentiate CI Aβ- from CN Aβ-. New biomarkers are needed to best determine the neuropathology of the clinical presentation of AD. NfL differentiated CN Aβ- versus cognitively impaired Aβ-. Proteomics (two platforms) did not differentially assess cognitively impaired Aβ--. Many novel biomarkers did not differentially assess cognitively impaired Aβ-. New biomarkers are needed to determine the neuropathology of AD clinical presentation."
41606074,Diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease with high accuracy via Petri net modeling of signaling pathways.,"Alzheimer's disease is a complex disorder of the nervous system. Diagnosing this disease is a costly process in which numerous laboratory tests and examinations are conducted. Most computational methods for Alzheimer's disease prediction face low accuracy due to challenges such as a limited number of training samples, noisy/overlapping data, and variability in gene expression. This study presents a reliable computational approach for predicting Alzheimer's disease through a new method of analyzing gene expression profiles from either brain tissue or blood samples. The proposed Petri net-based approach demonstrates superior diagnostic accuracy compared to existing methods across multiple gene expression datasets derived from both blood and brain tissue. The proposed method runs a Petri net model of the signaling pathways involved in complex nervous system disorders. In addition, the Petri net model provides step-by-step tracking of gene activation until the final diagnosis state is reached. An accurate understanding of the functions of the key genes of the signaling pathways involved in brain cell death will play a significant role in the early diagnosis of this complex disease and hopefully will lead to the identification of suitable preventive treatments or drug targets."
41599960,"High Prevalence of Probable Sarcopenia and Its Associations with Nutrition, Cognitive, and Physical Function in Hospitalized Patients with Alzheimer's Clinical Syndrome: A Cross-Sectional Study.","Probable sarcopenia, indicated by low handgrip strength, is a prevalent condition among hospitalized older adults and may reflect broader functional and nutritional decline. We examined differences in nutritional, functional, and cognitive status between Alzheimer's clinical syndrome (ACS) patients with probable sarcopenia and those without sarcopenia. A cross-sectional analysis was conducted on 194 hospitalized older adults with ACS. Probable sarcopenia was defined using European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP2) handgrip strength thresholds. Patients with probable sarcopenia (<i>n</i> = 137) had significantly lower Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI), albumin, hemoglobin, and gait speed compared to those without. After age and sex adjustment, MMSE (<i>p</i> = 0.023), GNRI (<i>p</i> = 0.002), hemoglobin (<i>p</i> = 0.022), albumin (<i>p</i> = 0.003), and gait speed (<i>p</i> < 0.001) remained significantly different. In the sex- and age-adjusted multivariable model (adjusted R<sup>2</sup> = 0.442), higher nutritional risk (β = 0.26, <i>p</i> = < 0.001), lower MMSE scores (β = 0.17, <i>p</i> = 0.029), polypharmacy (β = -4.20, <i>p</i> = 0.002), and slower gait speed (β = 4.12, <i>p</i> = 0.010) were associated with reduced handgrip strength. In the multivariable binary logistic regression model (adjusted for age and sex), moderate or high nutritional risk and slow gait speed emerged as independent predictors of probable sarcopenia, with OR 5.14 (95% CI 1.34-19.75; <i>p</i> = 0.017) and OR 3.13 (95% CI 1.30-7.52; <i>p</i> = 0.011), respectively. Probable sarcopenia in hospitalized older adults with ACS is highly prevalent and is associated with higher nutritional risk, poorer cognitive and physical function, and polypharmacy; its early recognition may help to guide more targeted nutritional and functional interventions."
