,Oxidative Stress as a Central Mechanistic Bridge Between Alzheimer's and Vascular Pathologies in Mixed Dementia: Emerging Evidence and Therapeutic Perspectives.,"mixed dementia (md), characterized by overlapping features of alzheimer s disease (ad) and vascular dementia (vad), represents the most prevalent form of late-life cognitive decline. increasing evidence identifies oxidative stress as a unifying molecular mechanism driving both neurodegenerative and vascular pathologies in md. reactive oxygen species (ros) contribute to amyloid- aggregation, tau hyperphosphorylation, endothelial dysfunction, and blood-brain barrier disruption, creating a self-perpetuating cycle of neuronal and vascular injury. mechanistic models demonstrate how chronic hypoperfusion and mitochondrial dysfunction exacerbate ros generation and neuroinflammation, while impaired nrf2-mediated antioxidant defense further amplifies damage. therapeutically, classical antioxidants show inconsistent efficacy, shifting focus toward mitochondrial protection, nrf2 activation, and lifestyle-based oxidative load reduction. therefore, we sought to outline therapeutic approaches capable of broadly targeting these mechanisms, through focused narrative analysis of recent studies employing delivery systems for antioxidant proteins and or redox-regulating mirnas. in particular, experimental interventions using mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (msc-evs) demonstrate neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects via the nrf2 pathway, suggesting promising avenues for multimodal treatment. integrating oxidative, vascular, and neurodegenerative paradigms is essential for advancing diagnostic precision and developing targeted interventions capable of addressing the complex pathophysiology of mixed dementia.",biorxiv,41595595.0

,Targeting the Gut Microbiota: Mechanistic Investigation of Polyphenol Modulation of the Gut-Brain Axis in Alzheimer's Disease.,"alzheimer s disease (ad) represents an increasingly severe global health challenge. recently, the role of the gut-brain axis in ad pathogenesis has garnered significant attention. dysbiosis of the gut microbiota can exacerbate core pathologies such as neuroinflammation, amyloid beta (a ) deposition, and tau hyperphosphorylation through neural, endocrine, and immune pathways. polyphenolic compounds have emerged as a focal point in neuroprotective research owing to their pronounced anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. notably, polyphenols exert effects not only by directly influencing the central nervous system (cns) but also through indirectly modulating the composition and function of the gut microbiota, thereby impacting bidirectional gut-brain communication. this dual mechanism offers a potential avenue for their application in the prevention and treatment of ad. this review aims to compile recent research on the relationship between polyphenols and the gut microbiota. we assessed the literature from pubmed, google scholar, and web of science databases, published from the establishment of the database to 24 november 2025. the keywords used include polyphenols , gut-brain axis , gut microbiota , alzheimer s disease , epigallocatechin gallate , quercetin , curcumin , ferulic acid , resveratrol , anthocyanin , myricetin , chlorogenic acid , etc. this review discusses the various",biorxiv,41596255.0

,Engineering nanobodies for drug delivery systems in Alzheimer's disease.,"alzheimer s disease (ad) remains a major global health challenge, with current therapies offering only symptomatic relief. a significant constraint in the development of effective treatments is the blood-brain barrier (bbb), as it greatly limits the access of therapeutic drugs targeting amyloid- (a ) aggregation, tau hyperphosphorylation and neuroinflammation. nanobodies, single-domain antibody fragments derived from camelids, have emerged as versatile tools with unique properties such as small size, high stability and the ability to penetrate the bbb. engineered formats allow for specific targeting of a and tau, receptor-mediated transcytosis, and conjugation with therapeutic or diagnostic substances. preclinical studies show that nanobody-based strategies can reduce pathological burden, attenuate neuroinflammation and improve cognitive outcomes in ad models. manufacturing scale-up, long-term safety and regulatory validation are among the remaining challenges, yet nanobody engineering represents a viable path to disease-modifying medicines. innovative approaches, including artificial intelligence-driven design, i.e. 4-1bb agonist nanobodies, and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat-facilitated diversification of nanobody libraries - such as targeted complementarity-determining region 3 mutagenesis followed by functional screening against disease-relevant tau or a conformers - alongside half-life extension strategies, are commencing to surmount these obstacles and enhance the potential of nanobody platforms to develop into clinically viable disease-modifying",biorxiv,41568664.0

,FDA-Approved Passive Immunization Treatments Against Aβ in Alzheimer's Disease: Where Are We Now?,"alzheimer s disease (ad) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder marked by decreased amyloid-beta (a ) clearance, enhanced a aggregation, an increased risk of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (aria), and blood-brain barrier (bbb) dysfunction. the i apoe4 i allele, being the leading genetic risk factor for ad, contributes strongly to these symptoms. this review covers the relationship between i apoe4 i status and the efficacy of fda-approved monoclonal antibody (mab) therapies, namely aducanumab, lecanemab, and donanemab. across several clinical trials, i apoe4 i carriers exhibited higher rates of aria-e and aria-h compared to non-carriers. while the therapies did often meet biomarker endpoints (i.e., reduced amyloid), benefits were only observed in early and mild ad, and cognitive benefits were often marginal. going forward, experimental apoe4-targeted immunotherapies may ease the burden of i apoe4 i -related pathology. the field is shifting towards a more integrated approach, focusing on earlier interventions, biomarker-driven precision treatment, and improved drug delivery systems, such as subcutaneous injections, receptor-mediated transport, and antibodies with enhanced bbb penetration. as it stands, high treatment costs, limited accessibility, and strict eligibility criteria all stand as barriers to treatment. by integrating the i apoe4 i genotype into treatment planning and focusing on disease-stage-specific approaches, a",biorxiv,41596530.0
